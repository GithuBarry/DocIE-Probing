# Models

Each model folder contains a few folders where we store some results:

- Ouptut
  Where we store model outputs run on datasets

- PostProcess
  Where we save scripts for formatting model outputs

- HiddenStates
  (Might not sycn via Github) where we keep encoder hidden states of examples.
