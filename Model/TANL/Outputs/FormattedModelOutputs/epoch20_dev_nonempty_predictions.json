campaign immersed the armed forces high command and the cristiani administration in confusion and insecurity since the beginning; and it successfully continues in its second day of fighting.    2.  the fmln fighters are using all their intelligence, energy, unselfishness, and patriotism so that a just peace is achieved in the country based on an authentic democracy designed to counter the genocidal reply that the military dictatorship has responded with.    3.  salvadorans who have withstood a bloody military dictatorship for almost 60 years see more clearly today the need to develop their legitimate defense against the repression which has been stepped up by the political, economic, and military hostility of alfredo cristiani's administration; and they understand the need to support and join the struggle for our country's liberty.    4.  we urge the honest and patriotic members of the armed forces to seriously reflect on the fact that they are not only facing the guerrilla army of the fmln, but a whole sector which claims its right to rebel.  we specifically urge the soldiers and officers in the battlefield to understand that our struggle is not being personally waged against you, but rather against the antipopular interests which are being defended by the armed forces upon orders from the fascists.    5.  the governments and peoples of the world are closely following the latest events in el salvador and their contribution will be valuable in achieving a national consensus based on democracy, a solution among salvadorans, and no foreign intervention.  the international community must help achieve a just and durable peace, thus avoiding more bloodshed.    6.  the fmln general command wants to report the atrocities being perpetrated against the civilian population by the armed forces who are indiscriminately bombing densely populated areas in san salvador, and issuing death threats against all the political and social groups, thus proving the regime's weakness and showing its antipopular and antipatriotic essence.    7.  we also urge the international community to help create special zones where children, the elderly, and wounded people from the battle zones can be evacuated.    out with the fascists!  febe elizabeth lives!    fmln general command    commanders salvador sanchez ceren, commander francisco jovel,

held a meeting with the chiefs of the two traditional parties, former presidents julio cesar turbay of the ruling liberal party, and pastrana borrero, of the psc.    the meeting held at the narino palace (seat of the government) was called so that barco vargas could report to the psc on the development of the most recent events concerning the new peace process that began with the m-19.    according to some political circles, in this manner the path toward peace might be cleared, inasmuch as one of the \"reservations\" the psc had was that the barco vargas government did not consult

ample evidence, no salvadoran government had blamed the armed forces of killing defenseless civilians since the civil war worsened in 1979.  the announcement made by president alfredo cristiani of the arrest of 45 soldiers and 2 officers for killing 6 clergymen, a maid, and her daughter, on 16 november is in itself a small and partial milestone.    cristiani, whose nationalist republican alliance party was founded at the beginning of the eighties by individuals linked to paramilitary bands, the army, and security corps, asserted that the names of those responsible for the crimes will be released in the next 48 hours.    jesuist francisco estrada, who replaced father jose ignacio ellacuria -- one of those massacred -- at the rectorship of the central american university in san salvador, warned that it is not enough to know which sargent pulled the trigger but who gave him orders to do so needs to be revealed.  cristiani will not go that far.    cosmetic sacrifices are made in order to neutralize the threat of u.s. congress interrupting the $1.5 million it sends a day for the war against the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) and the repression of the people.    the dismissal of general juan rafael bustillo as chief of the air forces and the possible punishment of some of the counterinsurgent atlacatl battalion fulfill these requirements.  however, cristiani will attend the next informal summit of central american presidents in tegucigalpa, honduras on 28 january under adverse conditions.    the mobilization of the latin american public opinion

commander manuel rugama acevedo, alias \"aureliano.\"  one of the men accused an official of the nicaraguan embassy in tegucigalpa of involvement in the crime.    \"aureliano,\" considered to be the second in command of the nicaraguan contras, was gunned down by an unidentified group in tegucigalpa's northern outskirts on 7 january after attending a working meeting with other rebel leaders.    the police detained hondurans juan bautista and rigoberto matute and nicaraguan luis ordonez, who are being held as suspects in aureliano's murder.  other suspects are still being pursued.    only bautista and ordonez were presented to reporters.  matute is being held outside tegucigalpa as a witness in the case.    ordonez said he \"participated only as a go-between\" so jose de jesus pena, the nicaraguan embassy official, could meet matute, who worked as a messenger for ordonez at the exchange office he runs in tegucigalpa.    ordonez added: \"i was aware that pena wanted to get rid of somebody, but i never learned who they were going to kill until 'aureliano' was eliminated.\"    ordonez also said he worked for the somoza regime, that he later aided the contras financially in honduras, particularly the rebel indian organization misurasata (miskito, sumu, and rama sandinist unity), and that widclife diego, a misurasata leader, owes him $25,000.    ordonez said further that he provided information on the contras several times to the nicaraguan embassy through pena, who gave him $1,000 almost every month.    ordonez denied that he participated directly in the crime: \"on saturday, 7 january, when 'aureliano' was killed, i was at a cock fight in el progreso\" on honduras' northern coast.    ordonez said: \"i also was in touch with the honduran secret police, one of whose lieutenants, working for interpol, called me up a few days ago.  he told me later, however, that other officers wanted to see me.  that is how i was detained.\"    in addition, bautista claimed that he was hired by matute during two meetings they held and that matute offered to pay him $10,000 to kill somebody, presumably a contra commander who also intended to kill matute.    bautista said that a few days prior to the crime, matute introduced to him another person, cano arteaga, who is still at large and who told bautista that it was ordonez who wanted the man dead.    bautista said that, on the day of the crime, he met with matute and cano.  they drove around the place several times until they intercepted the contra commander's car.    \"i opened fire with a .38 caliber revolver.  aureliano got out of the car and was hit by matute's shots.  cano finished him off.\"    bautista said his two companions were armed with .45 caliber pistols.  after the crime, they went their separate ways to wait to receive the promised money in a tegucigalpa park on 15 february.    police sources and colonel manuel enrique suarez, head of the honduran armed forces' public relations department, who presented the criminals to the reporters, declined to comment on the involvement of a nicaraguan embassy official in the crime.    suarez said: \"it is up to the honduran government to comment on this case or to try to establish whether a diplomat participated.  the police have already done their duty.\"    there was nobody available at the nicaraguan embassy in tegucigalpa to comment on the alledged involvement of one of the embassy officials in the assassination.  the embassy would neither confirm nor deny that someone named jose de jesus pena worked there.", "entities":

yesterday by terrorists on the drug cartel's payroll near itagui municipality.    the blast from the explosion hit a truck full of policemen, who had earlier carried out an anti-mafia operation in a peasant village, as well as several public buses, houses, and businesses.    a police expert said that the car bomb (containing 300 kg of dynamite) was activated by remote control as the elite force patrol passed by.    according to gomez martinez, \"these actions will only cease when (president virgilio barco vargas') government puts aside so much prejudice and agrees to the peace talks,\" proposed by the subversives.    \"the dialogue will take place sonner or later, and it is better to start now,\" insisted the mayor of medellin, a city where the world's most powerful cartel has its base of operations.    the chief of the criminal gang, pablo escobar gaviria, ordered the assassination of medellin policemen in retaliation for the government's action against the drug traffickers.  twenty-eight policemen have been killed in this city over the last two weeks.    according to security organizations, yesterday's attack \"could be escobar gaviria's response to the arrest of adolfo mesa meneses,\" his right-hand man.    mesa meneses was arrested last week by the administrative department of security (das, secret police), and the authorities have accused him of assassinating -- on orders from the mafia leader -- leftist presidential candidate bernardo jaramillo ossa, as well as a chief of police, a mayor, and several journalists.    meanwhile, hundreds of soldiers, policemen, and detectives are carrying out large-scale operations in the colombian countryside and border areas on the suspicion that escobar gaviria plans to flee the country.    last night, a television newscast showed photographs of the \"drug lord\" that had been \"recently\" taken by security organizations at a colombian beach on the pacific coast.    a police department spokesman confirmed today that \"we have reliable information on his whereabouts,\" although he refrained from giving further details.  unofficial sources said that escobar gaviria \"is somewhere in western antioquia department\" -- of which medellin is the capital -- where the search operations are concentrated.    colombian authorities have also asked for the cooperation of brazil, ecuador, panama, peru, and venezuela to stop the drug traffickers from escaping to those countries.", "entities": [{"type": "PerpInd", "start": 20, "end": 22}, {"type": "PerpInd", "start": 225, "end": 228}, {"type":

jaramillo ossa to a so-called gonzalo rodriguez gacha commando group. in these calls, it was said that the medellin cartel decided to resume the war because for five months it offered to negotiate with the virgilio barco vargas government, and the only response it received was to urge cartel members to turn themselves in to justice.    in addition, threats were made against other colombian political figures such as liberal party candidate cesar gaviria trujillo. the callers said that the extraditables released kidnapped people, delivered laboratories, and large quantities of dynamite as proof of their intention to talk, but they never received a reply from the government.    the callers said: we are going to turn ourselves in, but we will be dead when we do so.  however, before this

national liberation front (fmln) of the crime.    legislative assembly president ricardo valdivieso and vice president-elect francisco merino also declared that the death of the attorney general was caused by what valdivieso termed the guerrillas' \"irrational violence.\"    garcia alvarado, 56, was killed when a bomb placed by urban guerrillas on his vehicle exploded as it came to a halt at an intersection in downtown san salvador.    \"we have to condemn this incident, it is a guerrilla act,\" alfredo cristiani, nationalist republican alliance (arena) president-elect, who will replace christian democrat jose napoleon duarte on 1 june, stated.    cristiani said that \"these are the risks faced by someone who enforces the law.\"  he noted that \"the guerrillas' irrational attitude makes it increasingly difficult to believe they want peace.\"    according to cristiani, the attack took place because attorney general garcia alvarado warned that \"he would take measures against urban terrorists.\"    vice president-elect francisco merino said that when the attorney general's car stopped at a light on a street in downtown san salvador, an individual placed a bomb on the roof of the armored vehicle.    \"the driver told the attorney general about the bomb.  the vehicle swerved and the bomb exploded, causing the top of the vehicle to collapse on the attorney general's head,\" merino stated.    guerrillas attacked merino's home in san salvador 5 days ago with explosives.  there were seven children, including four of the vice president's children, in the home at the time.  a 15-year-old niece of merino's was injured.    \"these incidents,\" cristiani said, \"frankly cause us to become more aware of the fact that we must not permit terrorist actions to occur in el salvador.\"    the president-elect ruled out the possibility that these attacks \"will prevent the inaugural ceremony from taking place.\"    \"i am certain that the inauguration will be on 1 june.  we will not jump overboard or make a run for it.  we know what we are up against and will go on,\" he stated.    cristiani said the guerrilla attacks are intended to prompt a government and military reaction so the fmln can \"exploit it\" abroad to \"politically isolate the new government.\"    ricardo valdivieso, president of the legislative asssembly and an arena leader, said the fmln and its \"front\" groups are responsible for the \"irrational violence that killed attorney general garcia.\"    valdivieso said the legislative assembly will approve drastic laws to \"halt the wave of violence.\"  he said the attorney general \"was apolitical, worked for justice, and did not deserve to die like that.\"    according to the police and garcia alvarado's driver, who escaped unscathed, the attorney general was traveling with two bodyguards. one of them was injured.    the attorney general's body was destroyed by the bomb that exploded over his head.    no group has claimed credit for the attack yet, but police sources claim it \"is characteristic of the fmln urban commandos.\"    the same sources confirmed that garcia alvarado had been threatened on several occasions by salvadoran urban guerrillas.    moments after the attack, army and police units cordoned off the area and began an all-out military operation to find those responsible.    garcia alvarado, father of six, was appointed attorney general on 23 december 1988.  he was considered to be closely linked to arena. on several occasions, however, he said he did not represent any party and was carrying out his job \"impartially and with the intention of enforcing the country's laws.\"", "entities": [{"type": "PerpInd", "start": 74, "end": 76}, {"type": "PerpOrg", "start": 17, "end": 22}, {"type":

  the aeu representatives said they had evidence that the recent kidnapping of 12 student leaders, out of which 5 were later found murdered with brutal signs of torture, \"was directly planned and carried out by the guatemalan army.    these same students believe that vinicio cerezo's christian democratic government \"knows who is responsible for the campaign of terror, and it will not take action because the government is an accomplice of the military.\"    the aeu leaders, who did not dare give their names because their families \"could suffer worse consequences in guatemala,\" insisted that \"the only thing remaining for guatemalans to face the terror and violence is international solidarity.\"    \"the situation is terrible.  the human rights prosecutor himself told us that he could do nothing to contain this wave of repression and advised us that we better seek international pressure,\" one of the exiled aeu leaders said.    according to them, the wave of repression over the last few weeks against guatemalan university students \"is the worst since 1978,\" when numerous university leaders were murdered, including aeu secretary general oliverio castaneda, killed at point-blank range while heading a demonstration in the middle of the capital.    castaneda's murder forced the aeu to eliminate the post of secretary general and modify its strategies so its top leaders would not become easy targets of repression.  however, in light of the latest events, these changes seem to have had little effect.    \"because now they cannot identify any particular leader to kill, like they did with oliverio, this time they have attacked us all,\" one of the banished leaders , who arrived in costa rica last weekend, said.    since 21 august, when the campaign of student kidnappings and murders began, of the 16 members of the aeu executive coordinating board, three were murdered, seven are still missing, four had to go into hiding, and two went into exile.    \"i was told through a friend: your turn is on 4 september.  i then had to hide until i was able to leave the country,\" one of the exiled told afp with anguish.    \"we really did not expect this.  we thought we were going to be politically neutralized, but never thought they would order us kidnapped and murdered,\" another of the students admitted.    for both leaders \"the army's repressive campaign against the aeu seeks to scare the population and stop the people's movement that became motivated following the last teachers' strike all over the country.\"    however, they concluded, \"the army will never be able to end the aeu because to do so the army would have to kidnap, murder, or send into exile the 60,000 san carlos university students, the largest and oldest university in central america.\"", "entities": [{"type": "PerpOrg", "start": 122, "end": 123}, {"type": "PerpOrg", "start": 136, "end": 137}], "gold_templates": [{"incident_type": "kidnapping",

"colombian officials report that guerrillas presumed to be members of the pro-castro army of national liberation (eln) today once again dynamited the cano limon-covenas oil pipeline, colombia's major oil pipeline.    an ecopetrol (colombian petroleum enterprise) spokesman said that the explosion took place at km - 102 of the pipe near benadia in arauca intendancy, in the eastern part of the country.    this attack takes place 25 days after a previous guerrilla action, which interrupted the pumping of crude through the 780 - km long pipeline.  on 16 june, the eln destroyed the cano limon-covenas oil terminal on colombia's atlantic coast, in what is considered the most serious attack against colombia's petroleum industry in its history. since that time, colombia has been forced to suspend an average of 180,000 of the 220,000 daily barrels of crude piped through the country's leading pipeline.    today's attack is the 25th during 1989, and the third this week, the ecopetrol spokesman revealed.  the eln's attacks have reduced the nation's hydrocarbon production this year by 20 percent, with losses exceeding $180 million.  the eln has dynamited the cano limon-covenas pipeline 125 times since january 1988, causing losses of more than $450 million as a result of oil spills, halted production, the suspension of exports, and ecological damage, the ecopetrol spokesman added.    during the 25 years of its armed struggle, the eln -- led by former spanish priest manuel perez -- has intensified its attacks against the petroleum infrastructure, arguing that it perpetrates these actions \"to prevent the exploitation of colombia's natural resources.\"", "entities": [{"type": "PerpInd", "start": 4, "end": 5}, {"type": "PerpOrg", "start": 12, "end": 16},
