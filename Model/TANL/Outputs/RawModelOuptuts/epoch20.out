trigger_output_sentence following the u.s. invasion of grenada island , the world discarded any further possibility of a u.s. armed operation against another nation of the american continent , despite the deterioration of its relations with other governments and provocations against the u.s. government . it was believed that the u.s. would confine its participation to supporting and sponsoring movements aimed at ousting governments or , as in the case of nicaragua , of supporting rebel forces to achieve the goals set by the white house . the events that occurred early this morning in panama have surprised the world because , despite general manuel antonio noriega 's challenging attitude , no one thought the u.s. would invade panama . noriega was certain the u.s. government would not do so , and supposed that u.s. attitudes against him would consist of sponsoring rebellion , such as the recent 3-october attempt , when the u.s. government encouraged members of the panamanian defense forces to rebel against their commander in chief . noriega never thought the u.s. government would ever conduct a military operation against panama , although there were u.s. troops based on the canal zone . he continued under this impression because never before had these troops changed from their role of surveillance , not even when washington promoted the rebellion of some young officers of the panamanian forces . this excessive security distracted noriega and encouraged him to challenge the u.s. policies . noriega did not believe the u.s. threats and he adopted an omnipotent stance , like his recent decision to appoint himself the supreme leader of panama . noriega believed that the united states would continue to support subversion in his country , and that the u.s. decision to support the opposition currently in exile would produce movements against his regime , or that a commando might attempt to kidnap him . as a result of this belief , he increased the strength of the military forces and equipped many civilians who supported him with weapons to be ready to dismantle movements that tried to destabilize the economy .

trigger_output_sentence 1. during the years of dictatorship , chilean foreign relations were divided into two processes . on the one hand , as the dictatorship became more and more isolated , it was increasingly condemned in international fora and repudiated by international public opinion . on the other hand , as more and more countries and organizations expressed their support for a free chile and generously granted their solidarity to our cause , our organizations and democratic parties became increasingly open to the world . thus , they expanded their horizons and contributed their experiences . 2. during this period , the party has substantially strengthened its international relations and enhanced its vision of the international situation . it has strengthened its ties with the latin american peoples ' revolutionary and democratic cause , and it has fully immersed itself in the great debates of world socialism . to these debates we brought our views on a profoundly renewed leftist socialism committed to democracy , development , and social change . 3. our relations with the parties that make up the international socialist ( si ) and with the si organization itself have been enriched within this context . this strengthening of ties has been the result of two things . first , it is based on the position that in compliance with its principles the si has upheld regarding the chilean situation . in october 1973 , a few days after the coup , si chairman willy brandt condemned the end of the chilean democracy and president allende 's assassination at the un general assembly . at the time he also said this was a great step backward for those who aspired to achieve socialism through democratic means . since then , the si has been permanently mobilized in favor of chile by making the chilean cause and salvador allende the symbols of all international struggle for democracy and change . it is within this framework of interest and cooperation that the voice of chilean socialism has been heard and our ideas and proposals praised . 4. the second reason stems from the process of expansion and transformation experienced by the si in the past 2 decades . the overall process of change that took place in the world during this period -- the technological revolution , the growing interdependence among nations , and the struggle to overcome the social problems

trigger_output_sentence colonel rene emilio ponce , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said today that the offensive launched on 26 september by the farabundo marti national liberation front , fmln , was a mistaken step taken by the rebels within the context of the dialogue process with the government , which was resumed in mexico . col ponce said that with this attitude the rebels are not showing a real desire for peace , and he described it as a propagandistic action . today , during his tour of various areas of conflict , col ponce said that recent fmln attacks on various military positions as part of its latest campaign following the unilateral truce was a serious mistake on the part of the rebel commanders , as they have been carried out in the midst of a dialogue between the rebels and the government , which has been described as continuous .

( cristiani ) i believe there have been substantial changes in this presidential meeting as compared to previous meetings . to explain this better , marco antonio , we must say we will not fall into what has been used in the past , that is , the famous symmetry . on this occasion , we have been very clear and categorical when we said that we were not willing to continue contributing sacrifices and other things from the salvadoran government in order to solve the nicaraguan problem exclusively . we demanded uniformity , and any other country confronting the aggression of an irregular force -- any other country in central america -- also has the right to be treated in a uniform manner , as far as measures and criteria that may be adopted in the presidential meetings . that is why today for the first time you are seeing how the measures adopted for the nicaraguan resistance -- that had been granted most of the attention up to now -- are also being adopted for the fmln . we can not allow a country to claim it is the only target of an aggression by an irregular armed force supported from abroad . here in el salvador we now have greater evidence following this 11 november terrorist aggression that the fmln is a movement that can survive only with support from abroad , and that it obeys and exists because of international movements . in the second place , it has demonstrated that it only has the capacity to generate terrorism , which has been mentioned in this document . we can not continue just talking about demobilization and pacification in nicaragua . it is time to apply this to all irregular groups , be it the urng ( guatemalan national revolutionary unity ) in guatemala , or any other irregular armed group that may come up and may try to hinder the democratic process in the area . we see this as something that has gone deep within the t
trigger_output_sentence comrades : a new element that we must analyze and explain emerged at the conclusion of the central american presidents ' emergency meeting . let us see first why the meeting took place . the main reason is the very complicated predicament in which our offensive has placed cristiani and the high command . as you will remember , the government has met with much international disrepute and isolation because of the brutal assassination of jesuit priests and the bombing of the civilian population . let us recall , as a significant fact , that the united nations has condemned the government because of all it has done , especially because of the latest atrocities . on that occasion , el salvador was the only country that voted against that resolution while 96 countries voted in favor . we mention this case as a most significant one , but the fact is that there has been so much worldwide condemnation that the dictatorship has found itself in a really desperate situation . this was a cause of concern for the north americans . to whom could they turn at a time when all international organizations had turned their backs on cristiani ? the north americans had to resort to some forum that would not condemn the genocidal regime and that , on the contrary , would provide support in spite of all the atrocities the regime has committed . the most suitable idea was to promote an emergency meeting of central american presidents , because in central america , as we all know , the north americans have had their backyard and most of these countries serve their interests . the meeting was called to try to pull cristiani out of international isolation . under what conditions did summit take place ? we have to say first that the presidents of el salvador and costa rica , and probably of guatemala , had reached an agreement prior to the meeting . the subject of the discussion was a document drafted by arias and cerezo . this document expressed support for cristiani from the very beginning . joseph sullivan , a u.s. state department official in charge of latin american affairs , as well as other u.s. state department officials . u.s. state department

( begin recording ) ( maza ) the das has evidence showing that this individual masterminded two attacks including the the most recent and worst one in which more than 60 innocent people were killed . ( reporter ) how do you know that gonzalo rodriguez gacha masterminded the recent attack on das ?

( reporter ) ( question indistinct ) ( maza ) because the intelligence reports indicate this , and according to certain statements we have , he was overjoyed by the damage that he had caused in the city given the large number of people who were killed ; seeing him sunbathing and swimming on the atlantic coast led us to believe this . ( reporter ) is this a police reaction to the drug traffickers ' attack on das ? ( maza ) no , i am not saying that it is a reaction . this is the result of very professional work on the part of the national police . that is what i told the president today . i briefed him on the events which led to the action that has changed the situation which had prevailed in the country just a few hours ago .

trigger_output_sentence furthermore , we have had to struggle against many of our fellow countrymen 's skepticism and pessimism . the first thing the government did was to consolidate its bases to wage a struggle against those terrorist groups with whatever firmness and perseverance was called for . we strengthened investigation organizations , we created special public courts . we modified penal laws and procedures . we introduced new measures to encourage citizen participation and to protect citizens . we formed new components to bolster our public forces . our efforts took quite a bit of time . one can not provide an overnight solution for these complex problems with which you are all very familiar . once the institutions in charge of maintaining public order and security were strengthened , we concentrated our available resources on solving the crimes committed by those terrorist groups . the results have been increasingly positive , both in the fight against drug trafficking -- which is the central focus of many of these terrorist groups -- and in the struggle against gangs of hired assassins and private justice organizations , also known as death squads . never before had we achieved such positive results . i am sure that even though we will face difficulties and obstacles , we will continue to win this battle against terrorism . to date , we have disbanded 23 gangs of hired assassins operating in envigado in antioquia department , huican in boyaca department , puerto lopez and san martin in meta department , la rochela in santander department , and llanos del yari in caqueta department . these gangs of hired assassins had participated in most of the murders of the country 's leftist leaders .

trigger_output_sentence general hector gramajo morales has reported that last night 's terrorist acts were probably intended to damage guatemalan air force installations , but one of the explosive devices went off prematurely . he added that one of the explosive devices hit a wall of the air force installations and the shock wave from the explosion damaged some buildings . according to preliminary conclusions , the attack was probably a propaganda ploy because the devices were rudimentary and similar to firecrackers . the terrorist actions seem to be motivated by the fact that the irregular groups are shrinking considerably . evidence of this is the fact that a subversive who surrendered on the southern coast was carrying some important documents in which the guerrillas admitted that they had made a big effort to show their presence , but that nothing substantial resulted and they suffered many casualties instead , gramajo said . when questioned about the possible impact of these terrorist actions on the talks being held in oslo , norway , gramajo said that those who are taking part in the talks do not maintain contact with the groups that carry out the terrorist actions . among those groups , there is one faction that is called the international militant group . this faction is comprised of persons who love adventure ; these people take advantage of subversive groups to engage in some of these activities .

trigger_output_sentence regarding the jesuits ' case , the fmln states that : 1. the fmln and several sectors , including young armed forces officers , were right in pointing to the army as being responsible for this horrible crime . the responsibility of the armed institution for this case and the cases involving fenastras ( salvadoran workers national union federation ) , monsignor romero , the nuns , and the u.s. agrarian experts , as well as for the bombings in the cities and massacres in the rural sector , show that we were right when we mentioned in our last peace proposal the need to clean up the army and reform the judicial system . 2. to advance in the country 's democratization , it is not enough to solve this case . the other cases need to be solved and those guilty for them should be punished . the establishment of responsibilities can not remain at the level of officers and troops who only carried out orders . most important is to establish responsibility among higher-ranking officers because a decision of this sort could not be beyond the responsibility of the top command . 3. it is also necessary to comply with the esquipulas ii agreements concerning democratization ; reforming the judicial system ; lifting the state of emergency ; reestablishing freedom of expression , mobilization , and organization ; releasing the more than 3,000 political prisoners ; and stopping the repression against the church and other sectors . 4. the announcement by cristiani is an effort to resolve complicated discussions on u.s. aid for el salvador and to continue to benefit from this aid to maintain the war . it would be a mistake to increase aid to the salvadoran army because of this announcement or because the case may be resolved . such aid would leave open the possibility of seeing a case like that of the jesuit priests happening again . the best way to contribute to a negotiated solution is to cease aid . we appeal to the u.s. congress to make this decision . if this is done , the fmln would commit itself to making efforts to reach an immediate ceasefire . 5. favorable conditions for negotiations depend on justice-making

trigger_output_sentence the peace proposal presented by the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) general command sparked a debate of unprecedented broadness and duration to attain a national agreement to solve the conflict . the progress achieved must be increased , strengthening the unity and broad support of sectors that advocate peace with social justice and national independence . in this process , we have shown flexibility toward proposals presented by the government and the political parties . nevertheless , the christian democratic party ( pdc ) , arena ( nationalist republican alliance ) , and the military high command have closed the door to the possibility of holding elections without war , in conditions of cleanliness and equality that would turn them into an opportunity to solve the conflict . they insisted on holding the elections as part of military plan that tries to appear to be democratic to justify to the u.s. congress why there should be continued shipments of weapons and more millions in aid . there will be new election fraud and disputes between those who murdered monsignor ( oscar arnulfo ) romero and massacred 70,000 salvadorans , and the voracious corrupt devourers of millions who have mortgaged the country 's sovereignty . a fraud will take place in a militarized country , where more than half of the municipal offices are not functioning , and where the military manipulates the ballot boxes , votes , and results -- and they will do it again , as they have always done . within this framework , we have the legitimate right to support the people 's feelings and reject the 19 march elections , urging them to fight and reject the attempts to turn the elections into an instrument to continue the war , urging them not to vote or to void their ballot . the elections will attempt to legitimize the war , and they will be held in the midst of a war . the armed forces will be bombing civilians ; the police will be capturing , torturing , and assassinating ; the jails will again be filled with political prisoners . psychological warfare will be launched by the military high command by waving the specter of genocide over the population ; this amid the dramatic poverty of the deprived masses .

trigger_output_sentence the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) has decided to combine the people 's rejection of the 19 march elections with an intensification of actions throughout the nation . this includes the nationwide transportation stoppage , which we now declare to be indefinite . the rejection of the 19 march elections by our people and the impact of our actions have led the regime to launch a campaign of disinformation , aggression , and threats against the civilian population in a bid to confuse the population and , in addition , to set the stage for an electoral fraud . in order to make matters clear to our people as well as to the local and international press , we report the following : 1. the gagging of the national press is part of the plan to cover up the fraud that will be committed on 19 march . in addition , the control over the media is intended to attribute terrorist actions to the fmln . 2. the regime has tried to blame us for a number of actions , such as the attack on a red cross ambulance , among others , for the same purpose . the fmln has a definite policy of not harming the civilian population . the hurling of grenades at bus stops is a common practice of army personnel and it is therefore preposterous to blame the fmln . 3. a number of false communiques with an obvious terrorist tone have appeared . they clumsily glorify violence and threaten the press in terms that are quite unlike those appearing in documents in which we outline our official position . we emphatically state that the fmln has in no way or at any time threatened the press or the citizens . we recall the fact that our official communiques are signed by our general command and broadcast through our stations . we reiterate that the fundamental thing at this time is to reinforce and expand unity in the search for peace through every possible means . the struggle which we are waging with weapons in hand is aimed at an army that has once more denied to our nation the possibility of finding a formula for a negotiated solution at an important crossroads in the nation 's history . we made a proposal to hold free elections , in peace and for peace , but the army stubbornly insists on holding fraudulent

( cepeda ) colombia is experiencing an extremely severe political and institutional crisis , caused by the incompatibility between the fast developing productive forces and the existing political setup . for example , last year colombia 's economic growth was 4.5 percent . however , political life continues to be dominated by the two old parties -- the liberals and the conservatives , who maintain a merely formal democracy . we should not forget colombia 's strategic position : it forms a bridge between central and south america . all events in colombia affect the neighboring countries . precisely because of this , the so-called  santa fe-2 '' document , drawn up by extreme right-wing u.s. politicians , contains a plan to apply pressure in colombia and , more specifically , to expand the so-called low-intensity conflict , one of whose manifestations is the so-called  dirty war '' in the country . accordingly , the violence in colombia is caused by both internal factors -- the crisis of the institutions -- and external ones , namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the united states . ( sertov ) can one expect the peace settlement to be fulfilled under these conditions ? ( cepeda ) this is the aim of the communist party of colombia ( pcc ) . at our recent 15th congress , we made a detailed analysis of the situation and concluded that the conflict in colombia must be settled by political means . the pcc raised the question of removing the siege situation that , with a few interruptions , has been maintained for several decades , and of disbanding the paramilitary groups ( according to the minister of internal affairs , about 140 such groups are operating ) . these groups owe their very existence to the support given by military circles and the clan chiefs to the trade in narcotics .

( begin recording ) ( barco ) i came to make an appeal to you . let us all combine our efforts and energies in an alliance that is stronger and better coordinated than that of the drug traffickers . we need an alliance of nations affected by drug trafficking in order to respond effectively . drug trafficking is not the problem of a single nation , or even of a group of nations . it is a universal outrage . unless we devise strong and effective means of international cooperation to fight against all phases of the problem , a final victory will not be possible . for this reason , i wish to use this forum to make a new proposal to reflect the sense of urgency that we all feel with regard to this problem . we -- all presidents of the american hemisphere , along with president bush and our other colleagues of those nations most affected by the international drug trafficking scourge -- should meet as soon as possible to jointly exercise the public , political authority conferred upon us by the will of our people .

trigger_output_sentence you mentioned the attack on the residence of vice president-elect francisco merino . we would like you to give us some details on this . ( cristiani ) at approximately 0530 this morning , three explosives were hurled at his residence from an empty lot . the explosives caused extensive damage to the residence . there was rifle fire too , but the rifle fire was only to distract security personnel in the area . the attackers acted like animals . mr merino is still in the united states with his wife . he will be returning this afternoon . their four children and three of the children 's friends were at the residence when the attack took place . the children could have been killed . those who carried out this attack are people who for a long time have been talking about human rights and about indiscriminate [ bombings | bombing ] . this attack endangered civilians . thank goodness only one of the children was wounded . one of the girls who was visiting the home was hit by some shrapnel but the wound is not serious . right now we are getting a doctor to examine the children to see if their hearing has been damaged because two of the devices exploded in the bedroom the children were in . i believe this is another indication that the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) , far from seeking peace and wanting peace for the salvadoran people , wants to continue its terrorism , its killings -- its irrational killings . i believe that little can be achieved in the search for peace through dialogue because these people are not sincere when they claim that they want to resolve the problem . the salvadoran people are tired of violence . they stated their opinion on 19 march . the fmln should think carefully because the people have flatly rejected violence and the fmln . i do not believe that the members of our party will be frightened into abandoning the struggle for the consolidation of democracy , which is something the people want . i believe that those who want to make the fmln look like martyrs and like persons who work for the good of the people , should know the truth : they

trigger_output_sentence it is clear that neo-liberalism is the ideology of the north . if in the past liberalism was a factor that promoted progress and independence in latin america , neo- liberalism is now the state ideology of the more powerful nations . it is an authoritarian ideology that does not question all types of states , but only the states of the south . under the guise of eliminating bureaucracy and promoting efficiency , neo-liberalism wants to destroy the state to eliminate any resistance to the hegemony of the world market . we should not play that game . ideological nonalignment should therefore redefine the state and defend its strength in our countries . when i say state i am not referring merely to the individual states that every one of us represents . i am referring to an accord that our states should reach in each region . we must recognize that we are united in continental blocs . we must promote our regional economy . only through regional initiatives will we have power in the current process of restructuring the market . it is therefore imperative to call -- in each continent -- more frequent and regular meetings of our movement . we must organize the nonaligned movement on a continental basis to strengthen it in all places . many have come to this meeting to propose an administrative structure for our movement to insure its continuity . this can be viewed as a suggestion . it is a lot more important , though , to recognize the existence of regional differences and to create intermediate nonaligned movement organizations wherever possible . these intermediate organizations should strengthen the principles of the movement in each region , thus expanding its power . although it 's taken sometime , i believe that we have already adopted this approach in latin america through the creation of the political consultation mechanism of the group of eight , which gives common answers to the economic crisis and to political intervention . mr president , in honoring our founders -- tito , nehru , and nasser -- i should stress the ethical significance of nonalignment . without the power of nuclear bombs or money , we have upheld the moral values of mankind to help it to continue to struggle in all fields . therefore , our movement can not remain indifferent

trigger_output_sentence the fmln has done nothing but insist on an immediate answer to all of this . logically , i can not say that their 's is a serious position because when a number of documents are put forward , a period of time is required to analyze them . however , the fmln immediately rejected the government 's proposal , saying that it would not accept it . what does this mean ? that the fmln no longer wants to talk about the end of the hostilities , but wants to introduce new topics at the san jose meeting . however , despite the fmln 's position , and although there has not been an in-depth study of all the documents , one can see at first glance that the proposals they have put forward are totally absurd . i will cite an example : you know very well that the fmln has admitted to being unable to maintain a position , that if it attempts to occupy a town , in less than 24 hours the armed [ [ forces | attack ] | attack ] drive it out . it can not maintain a position in the country . nevertheless , the fmln proposal attempts to establish territorial limits with the government . while it is true that the fmln exists and is a reality , i believe that reality has a dimension , a size . the results of the past elections , the results of something over 3 percent ( won by the democratic convergence ) , indicate that the fmln is a reality but a very small one , and that it does not have the right to [ force | attack ] a government and a people to violate their constitutional system . meanwhile , the fmln has come up with the totally absurd notion that the government must dismiss the entire ( military ) class of '66 , the defense minister , and the commander of the air force . that is totally absurd , it is a ridiculous position that does not truly show any intention to movement toward peace . the fmln proposal also calls for the government to instruct the legislative assembly to change all of the supreme court justices . these , salvadoran

trigger_output_sentence president arias was right when he said that perhaps fidel castro is the only one who insists on the situation -- and who seems to have not yet returned from the sierra maestra where he was in 1959. that seems to be the attitude of the fmln leaders . what else do the armed forces , i mean ( corrects himself ) , does the fmln want with all these absurd proposals and attitudes ? it is seeking to divide the armed forces . it is seeking to isolate the government of the republic . it wants to ( discredit ) the government image , which has been consolidated little by little at the international level , because we are showing to the world that there is a democracy here , that a democratic process is being consolidated , and that the forces that already exist within the democratic system are forces that truly want and seek peace , rather than forces that assassinate and cause destruction . therefore , we can no longer think at this moment , that the fmln has only viewed the dialogue from a strategic point of view . however , we want to say something . all this strategy should not confuse the salvadoran people . we must be calm because the government of the republic will not give an inch and will continue , through rational means , to struggle and search for peace , to which you and all salvadorans are entitled . we are not going to fall into the traps the fmln is trying to put before us . however , at this moment , what we should see is who wants peace and who does not want to search for peace . up to this moment , the fmln has given no evidence it wants to attain peace and tranquility for you , the salvadoran people . nevertheless , we must not be pessimistic . although it is true that one can not say , for propaganda purposes , that outstanding results were obtained at the meeting in san jose , costa rica , some results were attained . the dialogue process will continue and that should eliminate all traces of pessimism . we must think that the dialogue process that began in mexico was not broken in san jose

( larios ) we must never forget that terrorists try to confuse and try to foster an attitude and actions in the people solely to justify themselves . at no time was the military delegation , which participated as advisers in the dialogue , able to influence the decisions of the dialogue commission . their role as advisers enabled them to give advice to the dialogue commission , but it is absurd to think that the presence of our two military advisers and other advisers prevented real and complex positions from being taken at that meeting . ( reporter ) there is no u.s. adviser ... ( larios , interrupting ) moreover , we can not ... . ( changes thought ) no u.s. adviser accompanied our delegation . if there was one , he went strictly on his own . your question , therefore , is important , because it allows us to tell you that the salvadoran military delegation never hampered the work of the government delegation during the talks .

'' it gave no names but said the group was formed secretly among officers fed up with corruption by a small group of military leaders . if authentic , the statement would mark the first time since a 1979 military coup that a group of junior officers had broken ranks with el salvador 's military leadership .  today more than ever , all the officers who truly want to save our institution , must demand and exact profound changes and a general purge at all levels of the armed forces , '' the statement said . the statement blamed a threatened loss of u.s. military aid on a few corrupt officers whom it held responsible for the  execrable '' assassinations of six roman catholic priests during a rebel offensive in november . el salvador is supposed to receive 315.4 million dollars in u.s. aid this year , 85 million dollars of it in military aid . but the u.s. house of representatives has voted to cut military aid in half and u.s. secretary of state james baker has warned that aid to el salvador will depend on progress in the priests ' case . the priests , their housekeeper and her daughter were murdered in their residence november 16 in the midst of prolonged and bloody guerrilla offensive in the city . nine members of the salvadoran armed forces have been charged in the killings but mr. cristiani has expressed doubts that they will be convicted .  it is truly sad and infuriating for us that the loss of prestige of the armed forces has grown so much

trigger_output_sentence the young military officers who have circulated a 5-page letter outlining their views contend that the violation of human rights and the neglect in correcting wrongdoings committed by the u.s. advisers and embassy are the main problems keeping the country mired in war . the officers add that they do not trust the current u.s. ambassador , whom they accuse of betraying truth and justice in the country in connection with the latest developments . the officers note the diplomat 's position regarding the case of the jesuit priests ; how he failed to denounce a colonel who accidentally discovered the culprits and how , lately , he has warned the high command about some information that was going to be made public by a u.s. network . the letter , which was released during the last few hours and is dated 1 may , expresses the young army officers support for colonel sigifredo ochoa perez , after the defense ministry , with the blessing of several commanders , decided to take the current president of cel ( lempa river hydroelectric executive committee ) to task publicly . in their letter , the officers state that they agree completely with the former military commander regarding which senior officers give orders to junior officers . we are obedient and nonconfrontational and that is why we continue to obey orders from superiors , but this must stop when the violation of principles and rights are involved , says the call from the young officers to the president and high command . the extensive document delivered to the media by the self-styled domingo monterrosa lives movement says that two of the officers it mentions were removed from their posts in the military order of 30 april . the young officers provide no further details but make some allusions to missions conducted while they did their duties . the document says that some of the senior officers who are obtaining money illegally must stop and mentions the names of former military officers who are now living and enjoying their wealth in exile . the document says that the contradiction raised by the above is the luck of some gentlemen officers who , at the end of their service , live abroad and enjoy their positions without any question . the document asks how some former officers are able to live so well when we know they

'' in response to a question regarding a letter from an unnamed group of young military officers advocating a purge of the military and supporting criticisms made by former army colonel sigifredo ochoa perez , cristiani says :  i have never believed anonymous letters or notes . the fact that it is anonymous casts some doubt on the intentions behind it or about the group that could be sending it . posing as young officers is easy to do . this could have come from the fmln -- making an issue of all that they have been talking about -- or from any other group .

trigger_output_sentence however , the fmln idea that they have to show force here , or there , or somewhere is not logical . the important point is that the salvadoran people want to live in peace and tranquility . therefore , it makes no difference that they may have 1,000 , 2,000 , or 100. that does not matter . i think that , whether they have a high or a low morale or whatever , with just 100 radicals they could kill people and destroy sources of employment . in sum , they cause panic and terror in some hamlets . i believe that has to be stopped . it is not a matter of who shows force and who does not . regardless of the demonstrations of force the fmln may carry out , we still believe that , in the long run , the military victory by the government forces and the government is possible , because they have a strong moral support . the government has been elected by the people and has the support of the salvadoran people . the people support the system and the government , no matter who is heading it , not just a particular individual . however , that is not the point . we do not want this conflict to last 10 years longer , with more bloodshed . therefore , we are searching for a political solution because we believe in it , not because it suits us because they are stronger or not stronger .

''  just as they imposed the war , today they are also imposing conditions that contribute to the search for a negotiated political solution , '' the guerrilla leader said . a u.s. senate subcommittee voted for a cut in the u.s. military assistance to el salvador and linked another cut in the aid to the progress made in the negotiation process to end a war that has lasted a decade and left 72,000 people killed . to deal with the cut in military aid , the government of alfredo cristiani said that the situation would force it to make budget cuts in other areas , such as health and education . in this regard ,  jonas '' said that the government warnings are aimed at maintaining the military struggle at the expense of  severely punishing the people and all lower-class groups .

trigger_output_sentence the military high command emphatically rejects the junior officer 's statements , considered a type of gray propoganda , because no person or group of persons has claimed responsibility for them . the statements are biased in favor of the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) . on 10 january 1981 a series of similarly anonymous letters and statements were circulated . the military intelligence learned that the letters were part of a strategy implemented by former captain francisco sandoval , along with other members of the salvadoran subversion . in addition , something similar happened in november 1989 , but this time it was done by a high-ranking member of the national union of salvadoran workers , who claimed that he had received a communique from junior officers on a number of irregularities that were reportedly occurring within the armed forces . the fmln terrorist groups launched offensives on both occasions . according to their goals , the final task was to seize power by force and by all means , even if they had to sacrifice the lives of many salvadoran civilians and severely damage houses and the country 's economic infrastructure . the armed forces are aware of their high level of professionalism and their own institutional ethics and philosophy as demanded by the constitution of the republic and reiterate that their mission will always be to defend the nation 's sovereignty and to protect each and every one of the salvadoran people 's life and interests . therefore , it is useless to try to undermine the armed forces ' morale and to confuse and divide all the members comprising the armed forces through groundless communiques which are intended to create false expectations for the national and international public .
trigger_output_sentence i have another question . a few moments ago , president cristiani termed the most ridiculous communique he had ever heard from the fmln the one in which they justified yesterday 's military actions . he termed them propaganda-oriented . within the framework of the negotiations , how do you view this ? ( ungo ) in my opinion , the fmln communique has aspects that are interesting and others which i think are not valid . the time and opportunity of that action is ambivalent . i think it has negative effects , as well as positive effects for them . there is always the famous vicious circle wherein if the fmln ceases to act militarily , it is bad for the fmln because it shows a sign of weakness . if it acts militarily it is also bad , because it shows that it does not want peace . in this sense , i think there is no doubt that it has exhibited a show of force , that its actions have been strictly propaganda-oriented or with propaganda objectives . it does not cease to create difficult conditions that generate a negative reaction on the other 's part , if they want to sit down and try to ease confrontations as much as possible and seek an agreement as much as possible . i believe , as i told president cristiani on the telephone yesterday when we spoke of other things but touched on this topic , that i uphold the government 's thesis . we have always criticized the fact that when negative things occur , they are invoked to suspend a process which in our opinion should be continuous . we have always upheld the continuity of the dialogue . the government criticized the fmln when on two occasions it suspended the dialogue due to terrorist actions on the part of the government or security corps . the dialogue and negotiation process has suffered as a result of this . i believe that in this case the government should take its own medicine . it should maintain the continuity of the process and not use as a pretext the fmln military actions to try to seek ways of conditioning or perturbing a process of dialogue and negotiation , which involves not only the government and the fmln , but the
