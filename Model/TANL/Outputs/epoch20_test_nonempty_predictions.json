(alvarez) is managua interested in eliminating all the contra leaders living in honduras or all people who are linked to the counterrevolution?    (membreno) on the contrary, we respect peoples' lives and that is why we have always been willing to receive in nicaragua all nicaraguans who want to accept amnesty and all those who have in one way or other been involved in the counterrevolutionary campaign.    (alvarez) have there been any more attacks against this embassy or any other type of threat, as occurred a few days ago?    (membreno) no, after the shooting incident at the ambassador's residence, what happened a few days later--here at the embassy--was that a car drove past the embassy at night and knocked down some security rails on the sidewalk.

especially the medellin cartel, set up several \"schools for gunmen\" in a vast region in the interior of the country with israeli, british, u.s. and west german terrorist instructors.  moreover, nbc warned of the presence of south africans.    the paramilitary squads are accused of hundreds of individual murders and massacres against political and labor leaders, as well as peasants and patriotic union leftist militants in different parts of the country.    the authorities are accusing these squads' killers of being behind the crime wave the country has been experiencing since last week, with

was senseless and illogical since absolutely no one other than the undersigned judge could decide if he or she had anything to inspect, or if he or she should or should not conduct the judicial proceeding.    the document, which is contained in the dossier on the massacre in la hondura and la negra, uraba region, says that she was left 2 days inside a plane at the airport of the texas

(maza) we are taking action the length and breadth of the country. we are not showing any special considerations because we intend to act indiscriminately.  what we want is to fight a scourge that has greatly harmed all colombians.

machinegunned by fmln terrorists on the evening of 4 april.    the wounded are mauricio campos and concepcion herrera, who were taken to a health center by the red cross, the sources added.    the

rosales hospital.    a military spokesman also reported that a group of persons who identified themselves as fmln-fdr members kidnapped a peasant, jose manuel posada, near la colmena, in el carmen district, cuscatlan department.    meanwhile, 9-year-old yohalmo antonio ortiz was injured by shrapnel when terrorists threw a bomb at civil defense members in nejapa, north of san salvador, while harassing the paramilitary group's outpost. the boy is at bloom hospital.    in the document signed by the government delegation and the fmln-fdr leaders, the latter pledged not to engage in terrorists attacks that might damage assets or injure persons, but \"urban commandos\" or \"terrorists squads\" that operate in san salvador have either not been informed of this resolution or they act independently, the military sources said.    referring to the 2 april car bomb explosion perpetrated in santa tecla, the fmln-fdr claimed responsibility for the attack in a communique, and said that it was \"an action aimed directly at the police\" and that \"they regret the death of a civilian,\" but they did not mention compensation for the relatives.    also, the fmln-fdr claimed responsibility for the attack on general rafael humberto larios's son-in-law, accusing him of being a military pilot -- when in fact he has been a civilian pilot and he was working in a small automobile spare parts distribution company at the time of the attack.    the young man, otto milla, is still in a coma and his pancreas was removed in the latest surgical operation.", "entities":

short the life of a man who had shown his will for peace and his commitment to colombia.  the crime was directed at hindering the development of the electoral process and destroying the reconciliation process that the government and m-19 (19 april movement) carefully constructed, surpassing many obstacles.  in this case, as in many others, this painful tragedy should serve to consolidate the ideals of peace and pluralism for which so many colombians have struggled -- one of them, carlos pizarro.  it should serve to reassert our repudiation of violence and our faith in democratic procedures.    further on the president's message notes:    pizarro's relatives and his followers know that the government, and i personally, feel strong wrath and sadness, but we will not be discouraged.  we will uphold the banners of reconciliation, pluralism, and the right to freely and peacefully express any idea.  we will also continue to unmask and combat enemies of peace.    the president adds in his message:    i interpret the desire of all colombians who admired carlos pizarro's democratic vocation, by warning those who are responsible for this tragic murder that they will not manage to destroy what has been worked for so hard and with the support of political forces and the people who voted for peace on 11 march to open a road for peace that is clear, possible, and defined.    the president's message continues:    you know that during this peace process, many enemies and difficulties were surpassed, but none has been so large as this tragedy that has shaken all colombians.  the obligation that lies before us is to keep open the road to peace that the murderers of carlos pizarro want to destroy.  article 95 of the electoral code indicates that when a presidential candidate dies, another person in his own movement has the right to take his place.  in compliance with this norm, the government will offer every facility for the registry of a new m-19 presidential candidate, so that he can continue to hoist the flags of peace and pluralism as is proper for a democratic debate.    the president also says in his message:    i have asked the government minister and the peace adviser to meet as soon as possible with m-19 representatives so that together they may study alternatives to confront such a serious situation. as soon as possible, the government minister will also direct contacts with the rest of the political forces to request their opinions about the present situation and to continue to give all the necessary guarantees so that the electoral process may develop according to what is established in the constitution and our laws.    the message ends:    i invite all colombians who are tired of so much violence to come to the polls in the next elections and vote for peace and pluralism. i invite all political and social forces to join in solidarity with the electoral process and defend the institutions that are threatened by violence.  it is time for good sense and prudence.  it is time to rise to the occasion and show our commitment to democracy.    this is the text of president virgilio barco's message on the murder mr. carlos pizarro

photograph of the candidate. the attackers also shouted threats against the members of the party's board.    we have already told the arica public, but now we want all of the chilean public to know, that the supporters of the yes-vote are desperate, because they see there are now more no-vote supporters than yes-vote supporters.    this is why the latter are threatening people, why they are

(begin recording) (rueda) communications to and from puerto petrolero and bucaramanga have been cut off since early today, after an attempt to dynamite the multipurpose pipeline destroyed a 100-meter section of the central highway.    the supply of gas to bucaramanga will also be affected by this event. it is estimated that it will take at least 3 days to restore normal traffic, because it will be necessary to use dynamite to remove rocks currently blocking the highway.    the attempted sabotage occurred at the 65-km mark on the bucaramanga - barrancabermeja highway, 20 km from the place where a military convoy was ambushed last wednesday. this is the second time that an attempted sabotage of the bucaramanga - barrancabermeja multipurpose pipeline, which carries propane gas, gasoline, and acpm (not further identified) has taken place. the explosion destroyed a 30-meter section of pipeline, and sparked a fire that has not yet been extinguished.    losses caused by the sabotage, which has been attributed to the eln, have yet to be ascertained. it is estimated that repairs to the highway alone will cost the public works ministry 5 million pesos.    (ismael orozco, public works director for the 5th district) well, after initial talks with ecopetrol (colombian petroleum enterprise) technicians today, beginning at 1700, after the fire is under control, they will begin restoring service on the oil pipeline.    (rueda) at this time, there is traffic congestion near the sugamoso bridge. (end recording) (passage omitted)    while still on the subject, ecopetrol's president, who traveled this morning to barrancabermeja to attend a forum on the magdalena river, reported that, so far this year, terrorist attacks have cost his company $300 million.  we have this report from maria clara gracia.    (begin recording) (gracia) ecopetrol has lost 95 billion pesos in revenues this year due to the 44 terrorist attacks on the cano limon - covenas oil pipeline. in these attacks, 13.2 million barrels of crude oil have been lost. the areas most affected by these attacks are in sucre, arauca, norte de santander, and santander departments.    (reporter alvaro ayala) doctor, could these terrorist attacks lead to an increase in fuel prices in colombia?    (dr andres restrepo londono, president of ecopetrol) obviously, there will come a time when, faced with increasing internal production costs and falling revenues, we are going to have to consider compensating our losses with an increase in domestic oil prices, but that is a measure we are not about to adopt at this time.    (gracia) today's landslide, which destroyed a section of the multipurpose pipeline between barrancabermeja and bucaramanga, has resulted in estimated losses totalling 1.435 billion pesos.

of age. he asked the government to establish guidelines to counter this social phenomenon.    amid this bloody and destructive situation, the peruvian episcopal conference has made a christmas appeal, asking that--without ignoring \"the seriousness of the situation\"--for a truce \"for peace, reconciliation, and tranquillity\" to prevail in the country.    the bishops said: \"recalling he who prevailed over death, we call upon those who have resorted to violence and killings as a solution to the evils of society, to allow the citizens for whom they claim to struggle to live like
