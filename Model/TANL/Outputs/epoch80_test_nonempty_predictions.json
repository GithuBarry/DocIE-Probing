(reporter) (words indistinct) commander, when do you expect the fmln to join the process?    (handal) look, deadlines are not the most important thing right now. what is important now is complying with the agreements to reach political agreements.  that is the main aspect of the geneva agreement.  it is possible that some deadlines will not be met. if deadlines are set and the time for implementing them expires, then this is tantamount to wasting time.  this then leads to steps being demanded that in reality depend on the political agreements that are reached and not the deadlines for reaching them.    therefore, according to the agenda and the timetable agreed to here in caracas, the accent is on the political agreements.  those agreements have to do with changes within the armed forces. everything related to the armed forces must be changed.  every factor concerning the armed forces must be reviewed from a certain point or perspective.  changes are necessary; changes must be made and those changes must be significant. these changes must completely transform the armed forces, beginning with its role and influence in determining the country's policies and guidelines.    we have been presenting proposals in this regard for some time. the topic of democratization is closely linked to the topic of the armed forces, to its purging, its reduction, and in sum, its end.  we believe that the country will not always need the armed forces.  as with any institution or historical factor, it emerges, it is maintained for a certain time, and then it tends to disappear.    the country must have the opportunity to develop. it cannot continue along the same path because this would only represent expenses and a heavy burden for the country.    for several decades, the armed forces have meant absence of liberty, real security, and the impossibility of the civilian society to decide the country's path.  elections have been turned into a mere formality, where those who were not elected run the country.    the country is now going through a drama that has also shocked the international public, the murder of the jesuit priests.  everyone is awaiting the results of the investigations and hoping that those who were responsible for this crime will be punished.  we believe that the case of jesuit priests is really grave; it is a drama that reflects the drama of the salvadoran people's history in the current century.

newscast managed to shoot video footage of the raid on the la maria farm on the outskirts of bogota.  here is exclusive footage and a report by william calderon:    (begin recording) (calderon) anonymous callers informed the authorities about la maria farm, a luxurious ranch located near asuba, a few kilometers from bogota.  at 1900, a goes (special operations group) team surrounded the ranch.  an agent makes sure the main gate is not electrically wired, and the decision to forcibly enter the house is made. they all cover one another as they take their positions.  these men are perfectly trained for this sort of work.  these is a light inside the ranch house, so they assume someone is inside.  tension rises in view of the possibility of an armed confrontation.  as he approaches the ranch, the commander decides to storm it.  moments later, several men open the door without offering resistance and surrender to the authorities.    a patrol enters quickly and controls every corner of the ranch.  other uniformed men support the operation from outside.  they unsuccessfully look for caches.  these three workers who were doing repairs at the ranch were detained as a precaution in the main hall.  meanwhile, the search continues in other areas of the house.  three safes were hidden in different rooms of the ranch house.  one of the safes was built into one of the eight marble-tiled bathrooms.  the huge kitchen was temporarily at the workers' disposal.  near the master bedroom was a large swimming pool with a ground-level window from the sauna and jacuzzi area.  there were several game rooms and tennis and squash courts in the house.    the authorities now have documents and photographs, although the residents of this luxury ranch had left before the raid.      nineteen other operations were simultaneoulsy conducted in bogota.  the authorities said afterward that they felt they had dismantled the bogota cartel.    the dijin released the following report: 10 persons arrested, including jesus evelio zapata lopez, the alleged head of this drug trafficking band that had international connections.    the following was seized: 3 certificates of deposit worth almost 250 million pesos; 1 1977 porsche similar to the one seized from jorge luis ochoa in 1988; 3 toyotas, one of which was sold 4 months ago by an ecuadoran embassy official in bogota; 3

broadcasts a 1 hour and 11 minute live or recorded speech \"to the nation\" by salvadoran president alfredo cristiani on \"the current situation in the country and the national recovery plan.\"  no date or place is given.    cristiani begins by saying that this is his first report to the nation after 50 days as president.  he notes that since he assumed power on 1 june, the farabundo marti national liberation front has increased its level of violence and its number of \"indiscriminate killings.\"  he says that there is no reason for this since he expressed on 1 june his desire find a peaceful solution to the conflict in the country.    cristiani says that since 1 june he has repeatedly called for a peace dialogue, adding:  \"in order to begin a dialogue of this nature, it must be held in two phases:  naturally, during the first phase both sides must sit down to discuss the mechanisms to develop that dialogue process, a timetable for the talks, and the place where the talks will be held.  in other words, the first phase will be to determine how the dialogue process will take place.  the second phase -- once an agreement is reached on how the dialogue will be held -- is what will be discussed.  in that regard, our government has not set any conditions.  we are willing to discuss any topic, because we know that we must find solutions to many things, and we are willing to do so.  the only condition we have demanded for this dialogue process is that, once it begins, it should not be interrupted for any reason.  we believe that people want peace as soon as possible, and we cannot hold talks for years.  once we sit down to talk, that dialogue should continue until an overall solution is found to the conflict.  that is our government's position, and we maintain that position because we believe it is the most logical one.\"    turning to economic matters, cristiani says that the country needs to solve three problems:  the fiscal deficit, inflation, and unemployment.  he says that as a first step to begin the national economic recovery is to reform the government's pricing policy, adding:  \"we must protect low-income groups, and for this reason we have asked the economy minister to begin a process aimed at eliminating price controls.  we believe that we can eliminate price controls on 230 products without having a major impact on the majority of the public and that we can keep staple products under the control of the economy ministry.\"  he says that price controls on staples like basic grains, powdered milk, flour, coffee, sugar, vegetable oil and lard, cement for housing, and oil by-products will not be eliminated.    regarding the transportation sector, cristiani says: \"we agreed with the transportation sector to deregulate the differential service. to allow them to continue serving low-income segments of the population while charging current fares, we will also allow them to offer the higher-priced service.  in other words, people will be able to choose what kind of service they want to use: whether they continue to use the low-priced service or a better, more comfortable, and faster service.\"    on electricity rates, cristiani says: \"we feel that adjustments to electricity rates should be applied as a result of power that is wasted, that is, because it is power that is being consumed beyond what is needed to live normally.  the increase in electricity rates will be directly proportional to the consumption of energy in each home.  we believe that with this initial measure, the cel (lempa river hydroelectric executive commission) solve problems.\"    turning to other economic measures, cristiani says:  \"we have to take short-term measures too.  in this respect, the most logical step is to take measures that will affect consumption and not revenues. thus, we have asked the finance minister to take measures related to taxes.  he is to consolidate tax payments and only exempt the previously mentioned basic bread basket items from the present 5-percent tax.  we have to start eliminating tax exemptions.  only exports should have some type of monetary incentive because our country is interested in developing its exports.  the rest of the country's economic sectors should be taxed at the same rate.\"    cristiani adds:  \"we are going to modify the system of paying income tax.  we believe that the current system is based on unjust regulations, on revenues earned the previous year that do not reflect a firm's present situation.  thus, we are going to request that income-tax payments be based on a small percentage of the firm's present sales; these are a truer and more accurate reflection of a firm's income.\"    cristiani says that the country's monetary policy must be aimed at increasing savings to promote domestic economic development.  he says that it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the country's banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country. regarding the country's currency, cristiani says:  \"we feel that currency value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign exchange.  we do not think it is appropriate for the government to arbitrarily devalue and fix an exchange rate on the salvadoran colon. everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to pay out for imports, because if we were to fix the rate at 10 (colones) to 1 (dollar), the central banks still would not have enough foreign exchange to cover all the importers' demands.\"    further

(azcona) well, i do not know.  it is not easy to solve this problem. none of the problems will be easy to solve.      (reporter) is there a possibility for dialogue?    (azcona) yes, but the nicaraguan government would also have to hold a dialogue with the nicaraguan resistance.    (reporter) i am the voz de nicaragua reporter.  what is your opinion of the agreement reached by the nicaraguan government with the political parties?    (azcona) well, i read the agreement last night and believe it to be a step forward.  incidentally, i read it twice last night and it is a very long document.  i am talking about the agreement with the parties that are truly opposition parties and not the one made with the other parties because these are not really opposition parties.    (reporter) what i wanted was your opinion on the demobilization of the contras from honduras.      (azcona) oh, you are talking about the small document that makes demands, demands, and more demands.  this document has no value.      (reporter) i mean the document signed with the 21 political parties...      (azcona, interrupting) that agreement is valuable but it does not mention the contra demobilization.  the document states that the nicaraguan government and the opposition parties agree that the esquipulas ii and costa del sol agreements should be abided by.  this is the document i read twice, and i believe it is quite serious and a step forward.    (reporter) what will you do to get the mercenaries to leave your country?    (azcona) first, i do not use derogatory terms.  they are nicaraguans who for different reasons disagree with the system in nicaragua.  these nicaraguans oppose the system, and for this and other reasons they have taken up arms against the system and have taken refuge in honduras.  i do not use the term mercenary.  i understand the nicaraguan government uses it and it is all right for them to do so, but i will not answer a question that uses a term that i believe is too derogatory.    (reporter) the demobilization plan has a very firm deadline and is to be completed within 90 days.  do you think...    (azcona, interrupting) no, no.  the 90-day deadline is included in an agreement signed by nicaraguan president ortega with three small nicaraguan leftist parties.  i do not believe this document is very important.  i do believe, however, that the agreement signed by the nicaraguan president and the opposition parties is important because it is based on the esquipulas ii and costa del sol agreements.  (words indistinct) terrorists in el salvador and contras are presently not active, so both situations -- contras and guerrillas -- are different.    (reporter) is it true that president cristiani is going to present a parallel program at the summit?    (azcona) (words indistinct) president cristiani comes to the summit as el salvador's legitimate president.  he has the right to present his points of view.  he has the right to contribute to the solution of problems in other countries as well as to ones in his own country.    (reporter) is there a possibility that a demobilization plan for the salvadoran guerrillas will be studied at this summit if president cristinai presents one?    (azcona) of course.  he has a right to do so.

which cites reliable sources, it seems that the hand of drug traffickers is behind the assassinations of judge carlos valencia, of the bogota (words indistinct), which occurred yesterday (18 august).  the colombian drug mafia has created a great money and crime empire in colombia with powerful ramifications outside its borders, especially in the united states -- the main consumer of cocaine and other drugs in the world.    yesterday (18 august), venezuelan president carlos andres perez spoke on the phone with his colombian counterpart, virgilio barco, and it is said that the main subject of their conversation was the relationship between youth delinquency and drug trafficking.  it is important to note the words of venezuelan president carlos andres perez.  we must reflect, said carlos andres perez, on the need for us, all venezuelans, to face drug trafficking in venezuela.  we must also acknowledge that drug trafficking is the abominable crime of our times, and that there cannot be any hesitation or compassion toward drug traffickers.  those are the words of venezuelan president carlos andres perez.    in reality, the drug trafficking drama is seriously affecting several latin american countries.  we have the dramatic case of colombia, but the situation also exists in venezuela, bolivia, peru, well, in several latin american countries.  now, the solution to that problem...(rephrases) as has been pointed out by latin americans themselves and their most prominent figures, the final solution to the dramatic drug trafficking problem must be based on putting an end to the consumption of drugs.  that is the main stumbling block in the fight against drug trafficking.  the united states is the main consumption center of drugs in the world, and u.s. policy on drug trafficking is not consistent with the need to put an end and actively repress the consumption of drugs.  u.s.  policy, and all this is very well known in latin america, is based on destroying the plantations of a native plant in the continent, which is coca.  presidents, political and social figures of the continent have said that the solution is not based on the destruction of a native plant but in active fight against drug consumption.    i think that the statements made by the president of venezuela and the dramatic situation that colombia is facing these days confirm that the policy for fighting drug trafficking must be tenacious, strong, without hesitation and compassion.  it must also be based on ending drug consumption by the united states -- the main drug consumer of the world -- which lives precisely from drug consumption and its business.", "entities": [{"type": "PerpInd", "start": 29, "end": 31}, {"type": "Victim", "start": 37, "end": 39}], "gold_templates":

these two countries are known for their cocaine crops and the drug cartel's organized activities.  in addition, extremist right-wing and left-wing organizations there are actively trying to achieve political goals through terrorist activity.    hadashot has learned from a source who was in peru for about 6 months that elements linked to the drug growers spent approximately $9 million on military equipment from israeli arms dealers in 1987.  the equipment included galil rifles, flak jackets, ammunition belts and ammunition, various types of grenades, and communications and night vision equipment.  in 1988 and 1989, in additional deals worth some $6 million, mortars, shells, sniper rifles, and ammunition for light weapons were purchased.    the arms were sent to peru via mexico and guatemala.  at least 3 idf (israel defense forces) reserve officers were in peru for over 2 months in early 1988 to organize fighting units.  the peruvian fighters were presented to the officers as belonging to right-wing political bodies in the country, and the team of instructors included mercenaries from the netherlands and england.    the team of instructors was made up of some 10 people, some of whom were recruited through an israeli-netherlander arms dealer who lives in amsterdam.  the netherlands media is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into the subject despite the surprising lack of interest by the netherlands authorities in the affair.    at the same time, israelis in neighboring bolivia acted as instructors in a course on safeguarding businessmen, guerrilla warfare, and regional defense.  these israelis reached bolivia in the wake of an arms consignment worth some $12 million, which arrived in peru (country as published) via a third party, which purchased it in an african country, which in turn had received it from israel.    following the reports on deals by israelis abroad, the income tax investigations division has begun an inquiry into tax payments on israeli arms deals and training abroad.    in the past 5 years, the scope of commissions paid to arms dealers is estimated at $1 billion.  at least half of it went to big dealers, such as sha'ul eisenberg, marcus katz, pesah ben-or, israces, and others.  they are not under suspicion of trying to cheat or hide information from the tax authorities.", "entities": [], "gold_templates":

marquez confirmed today that the government and the judicial authorities had known for over 1 year that there were mercenaries in our country, but police authorities apparently prevented an investigation that had been ordered, as a matter of fact, by a female judge.  our reporter hernando corrales has the details:    (begin recording) (corrales) if the authorities in charge of an operation near puerto boyaca on 18 july last year had not sabotaged it, the foreign instructors at the service of the medellin cartel would now be jail.  on that date, marta lucia gonzalez, second judge of public order, wrote a file note saying that the judicial inspection was unjustly torpedoed with the argument that nothing had been found and that this argument was senseless and illogical since absolutely no one other than the undersigned judge could decide if he or she had anything to inspect, or if he or she should or should not conduct the judicial proceeding.    the document, which is contained in the dossier on the massacre in la hondura and la negra, uraba region, says that she was left 2 days inside a plane at the airport of the texas petroleum company in puerto boyaca and that the police authorities accompanying her failed to explain to her why they had not taken any action.    (unidentified speaker) in fact, she and several das inspectors encountered some obstacles.  the attorney general's office was informed of these obstacles in order for it to make an investigation. i think that when she and the das personnel were preparing to go to puerto boyaca it was already known that these people would be present there for these proceedings and this was quite worrisome.    (corrales) as is known, judge gonzalez had to leave colombia because her life was threatened, and her father, former boyaca governor alvaro gonzalez santana, was subsequently murdered.    moreover, gen maza marquez said further that the fact that a payment is being offered for the capture of pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha does not mean that other persons accused of being capos of the mafia are not being sought too.    (maza) we are taking action the length and breadth of the country. we are not showing any special considerations because we intend to act indiscriminately.  what we want is to fight a scourge that has greatly harmed all colombians.

that with this attitude the rebels are not showing a real desire for peace, and he described it as a propagandistic action.    today, during his tour of various areas of conflict, col ponce said that recent fmln attacks on various military positions as part of its latest campaign following the unilateral truce was a serious mistake on the part of the rebel commanders, as they have been carried out in the midst of a dialogue between the rebels and the government, which has been described as continuous.    (begin recording) (ponce) that shows there are, on the one hand, the proposals and what the terrorist leaders call their desire for peace, and, on the other hand, the real actions.  i think that the campaign the fmln has mounted nationwide was a bad step, because it does not show a real and sincere desire to seek peace in our country. (end recording)    colonel ponce added that the request for reducing the number of troops as stated in the guerrilla proposal is a political move.  he played down the latest rebel offer presented to the government in mexico.

presidents of argentina, brazil, colombia, mexico, peru, uruguay, and venezuela.    panama's role in the group of eight has been suspended because of that country's current political situation.    the same source dismissed the idea that peru may be planning to break diplomatic relations with panama because this would affect peru's links with the panamanian people and \"this is not the position of the group of eight member countries.\"    panama has had an ambassador in peru for 40 years, but only for \"personal reasons\".    in the private dialogue with efe, the source said that \"the panamanian ambassador seemingly does not understand the messages sent by the peruvian government through its recent actions.\"    in early september the peruvian government removed its ambassador to panama, mr mario castro arenas, for an indefinite period and downgraded relations between the two countries to the level of charge d'affaires.  peru did this after announcing that it would not recognize the legitimacy of the new panamanian government headed by francisco rodriguez.    asked if the panamanian diplomat would be invited to leave the country, the source said that \"this has not been considered because that would imply breaking relations with panama, and peru does not want to go that far.\"    in comments to a television reporter last sunday in lima, foreign minister guillermo larco cox said that president alan garcia will propose the definitive expulsion of panama from the group of eight.    the foreign ministers of argentina, brazil, mexico, uruguay, and peru began a 2-day meeting in trujillo today and their agenda includes the situation in panama, the fight against drug trafficking, terrorism, the foreign debt, and the integration process.    trujillo, 550 kilometers north of lima, is normally a quiet area, but it now gives the impression of being a militarized city.  this military presence is aimed at deterring sabotage and attacks by terrorist groups.    at least 5,000 policemen and soldiers are guarding all entrances to the city.  there is even heavier security at the plaza de armas zone, where the foreign ministers will meet.  no vehicles

important achievements of this campaign has been the combining of the campaign with the just economic, political, and social demands that the democratic forces and the popular movement have been making for these 16 years of dictatorship.  these demands are related to the struggle against repression, the defense of human rights, the denunciation of crimes committed by the regime, and efforts to fight immunity and the suppression of the truth regarding torture, disappearances, and assassinations. these questions have once again come into the spotlight now that many rightist candidates are demagogically attempting to pose as defenders of human rights and since el mercurio has reported that the dictator is planning to convert the cni (national information center) into an agency of the army so that the main repressive body from all these years can be under his direct control.  jaime inzunza, leader of the united left and the communist party of chile, discusses these topics over a direct phone line from santiago, chile.    (begin recording) (announcer) how are the chilean people's demands connected to the ongoing electoral campaign?    (inzunza) they are connected through the democratization of the neighborhood boards during the electoral process; the strengthening of the unified actions of workers; the development of the committees for victory, which will also be committees for the defense of victory and committees for carrying on the democratic task; the development of confidence; the struggle for human rights, particularly concerning truth and justice and immunity for crimes; the increasing pressure by the immense majority of the population for the release of all political prisoners; and naturally for the dissolution of the cni. all of these questions are being brought up in the electoral campaign, and agreements have been reached within social organizations.  this was evidenced a week ago by the salvadora strike and by the current strike by coal miners.  this proves that the people have understood that the electoral campaign has to be an expression of their activities and a way to strengthen their social organizations for the future struggle. (end recording)    the preceding comments were made by communist party of chile leader jaime inzunza, who has been interviewed over the telephone on our program \"escucha chile.\"  another topic discussed by inzunza was the el mercurio report on the cni's transfer to the army.  the dissolution of the cni has become one of the most pressing demands of the immense majority of chileans.    (begin recording) (announcer) what is your opinion, jaime inzunza, on the dictator's intention to maintain the cni as it is and to keep it under his direct command?    (inzunza) i believe that this issue is particularly serious.  the intention is to maintain intact the main terrorist apparatus of the dictatorship, which has been responsible for the most flagrant violations of human rights throughout the years of its existence.  i understand that the dina (national intelligence directorate, replaced by cni) and the cni have been in fact a single apparatus and therefore the main organs of state terrorrism over the past 15 years.  if transferred to the army, the cni would continue to be under pinochet's orders.  under whose orders has it been all these years?  for whom has it been a direct agent all these years?  henceforth it will be under the control of the office of the commander in chief of the army. (end recording)    communist leader jaime inzunza added that pinochet's intent in transferring the cni to the army's direct command is to make the institution an accomplice in concealing people who have been responsible for crimes and human rights violations.    (begin recording) (inzunza) the idea is to involve the military institution in crimes for which the chilean people knows it was not responsible.  this is clear: what the democratic opposition forces want is to have the culprits behind those crimes and human rights violations prosecuted, not the military institution.  the transfer of the cni to the army is an attempt to make the men in uniform act as accomplices or accessories to those crimes.  loyalty is not at stake here; loyalty is defending values and principles, not some sort of criminal complicity that is not in line with the training of these men.  this seems to me to be particularly serious because this transfer implies maintaining the cni under the orders of the man responsible for the crimes committed all these years, the dictator himself.

northern san salvador where some 300,000 persons live.    commander amilcar, one of the rebel chiefs who has occupied the zacamil neighborhood, told acan - efe that he and his men came to san salvador \"prepared, and with sufficient ammunition to remain for several days.\"    in a general assesement of the guerrilla offensive, the young commander said that the army \"cannot enter\" the \"area under rebel control,\" but it is attacking the rebels from the national police headquarters and using helicopter gunships.    \"however, the people have the trump card (for the success of the offensive),\" he added.    amilcar, who is 26-years-ago and looks like a student, was walking down the hallways of one of the cramped five-story apartment buildings in zacamil while explaining that the goal of the rebel offensive is \"to seek options for building peace in el salvador.\"    he added that the guerrillas seek \"to disrupt the dialogue conditions, and go to the conversations with a political and military advantage so that the government will agree with us on what the people want: democracy, a people's economic policy, and a purge in the armed forces, among other things.\"    the guerrillas and the government of el salvador have held two meetings in recent months, the first one in mexico and the second one in costa rica.  a third meeting was to be held shortly in venezuela, but the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) announced that it will not attend.    the fmln launched the most important military offensive since 1981 on 11 november, attacking 50 military positions, 20 of them in san salvador.    in the first 24 hours, the offensive has caused nearly 300 casualties (127 dead and 155 wounded) according to the army, and over 400 casualties according to the guerrillas.    the offensive has been named \"out with the fascists! febe elizabeth lives!\" in homage to a trade union leader killed 13 days ago along with nine other workers in a dynamite explosion in the capital city attributed to the ultrarightist death squads.    armed with an automatic ak-47 rifle, amilcar said that the fmln \"has consolidated the zacamil, cuscatancingo, mejicanos, and panama neighborhoods, and we have besieged the 1st infantry brigade.\"    all the places he mentioned are in northern san salvador, where the bloodiest clashes between the guerrillas and the government troops have taken place.    at nightfall on 12 november and prior to the curfew that begins at 2000 (0200 gmt), the residents of zacamil were outside their buildings carrying candles as there is no electricity.    amilcar assured that the guerrillas have inflicted at least 18 casualties on the armed forces in that area and have seized about 20 rifles and 1 m-60 machinegun.    \"this offensive is a military and political achievement. as a result of the closing of the comalapa international airport, the main airport of the country, we have succeeded in letting the world that we are at war and are an emerging power,\" the rebel commander said.    comalapa airport, located 50 km south of san salvador, was closed \"for security reasons.\"    acording to the fmln clandestine station, radio venceremos, the guerrilla fighters destroyed three military helicopters on the ground and caused some damage on the airports's main landing strip.    referring to the government's decision to impose a curfew and a nationwide state of siege effective tonight, commander amilcar said: \"we had already taken this into consideration when we launched the offensive.\"    the government \"cannot act indiscriminately against the civilian population,\" amilcar said; adding that \"the citizens' rights were suspended to bomb the places taken over by our forces.\"    the people of zacamil and other neighborhoods located north of the capital have lived in terror since saturday, 11 november, when they were trapped in the crossfire between the rebels and the military, subjected to the air raids and the threat that living with the guerrilla members represents to them.    at least two civilians have died in zacamil and five more have been wounded, including two children, as a result of the armed clashes.", "entities": [{"type": "PerpInd", "start": 403, "end": 406}, {"type": "Victim", "start": 371, "end": 373}, {"type": "Weapon", "start": 394, "end": 395}, {"type": "PerpInd", "start": 616,

leaders in the nine departmental capitals, thus thwarting the extended hunger strike.    the strike by teachers, who have been demanding a bonus of 300 bolivian pesos, has unleashed violent street confrontations over the past few days and at least four bombings.    the government, which has been besieged by a wave of social demands and pressured by the 80,000 teachers, has stated that these demonstrations are undermining democratic stability. it added that despite efforts to find a path to peaceful coexistence and dialogue, it has not been possible to prevent radical groups interested in the union leadership from publicly challenging the government.    the government decree states that it will guarantee the 3 december municipal elections and protect the citizens' right to vote.    a few minutes before the release of this decree to the press, police patrols raided the centers where the hunger strikes were taking place.  police used excessive force in these raids.    the 250 strikers arrested in la paz were taken in trucks and buses of the police, the air force, and other state institutions, to the el elto air base.    the government reported that 250 strikers were also arrested in the interior of the country. it added that those responsible for the strike will be sent to different regions of the country. other, less responsible groups of strikers will be tried by the regular courts. others will be released.    the three la paz teachers' leaders have been sent to different hospitals in la paz and placed in intensive care. they are miguel lora, telmo roman, and luis alvarez, who are not facing any risk of death, the interior ministry under secretary stated.  he warned that the bolivian labor confederation underground sessions will be illegal, and they are

cynically saying it knew nothing about them.  however, that acknowledgement is even more hair-raising than the denial.  hear us well: the u.s. government has stated that it supports the government troops' efforts to crush the offensive which has caused so many personal tragedies; and it praised the army for decreeing strict laws to prevent civilian casualties.    we also hear the pet expression that the fmln is using civilians to protect its fighters, and the principle of removing the people from their environment is unscrupulously applied once more.  this is why the northern part of the country was destroyed, leaving entire towns in ruins -- and now large areas of the country's most important cities are being destroyed.  one day those ruins will become the evidence we will show our children to prove that fascism once existed in the country.    however, the u.s. imperialism's clumsiness goes even further.  the north americans apparently want to become involved in a large-scale conflict -- for the sake of a few death squad members who have already earned the world's scorn -- given the decision to send u.s.  pilots to bomb the civilian population by night.  the fascist salvadoran dictatorship has unleashed the brutal tactics used by somoza before leaving power.  on that occasion the u.s. imperialism turned its back on the tyrant.    the united states' foreign policy have never stooped so low and the decisions adopted by the u.s. government have never brought the possibility of a regional conflict so close.  what does the nicaraguan government think about the airplanes being flown by u.s.  pilots only a few hundred km from its border?  what will happen if guatemala continues to involve itself in the salvadoran conflict?  the consequences are unforeseeable.  the u.s. imperialism has soiled its hands with a new genocide in el salvador.  the u.s. people should deeply reflect about this and stop their government from provoking contempt of that nation -- which is being disinformed and intoxicated by the anti-communist propaganda.    large groups of abraham lincoln's people, the best sons of the united states, have reacted and have taken to the streets --deep inside the u.s. imperialism's heart.  soon, very soon, this will become an unstoppable surge.  the u.s. government's strategic goal is clear: the salvadoran people.  the u.s. government wants the salvadoran people to (words indistinct).  to quote monsignor (oscar arnulfo) romero, the army -- and in this case the north americans -- are like serpents, which only bite the shoeless.  yet they

 the aircraft is a cessna 310.  the identity of the crewmen in the nicaraguan planes that crashed in el salvador over the past weekend carrying soviet arms is a state secret acceded to by la prensa this morning after getting in touch with a high-ranking source in the sandinist army.  the source disclosed further details of the butterfly operation.  the army source, which of course requested to remain anonymous, confirmed that the plane that crashed in san miguel belongs to nicaragua and that the plane's registration is yankee november bravo yankee kilo.    there are no reports so far as to whether any relatives have claimed the bodies of the four military men who were reportedly killed when the plane crashed. three of the crewmen were killed instantly, while the fourth committed suicide.  a picture of a young cuban girl, dated in july, is the only published clue as to the identity of the men, whether nicaraguans, cubans, or salvadorans, commissioned for this clandestine mission directed from nicaragua.  our source said that young salvadoran guerrillas were trained at the national civilian flight school over the past few months.  the training was supervised by captain robin romero, the flight school's director.  the training was also conducted at punta huete and los brasiles.  most of the flights were made at night. the student pilots used oil lamps as landing lights.  the source said the training flights were conducted in light single-engine planes from sandino airport to punta huete or los brasiles.    the head of this operation was commander christian pichardo.  in the operation also participated two salvadoran guerrilla commanders whose identities are unknown.  the cessna 310 had been leased by the national development bank (bnd), which in turn had acquired the plane from the zeta national charter service, an aeronica subsidiary.  bnd administrative director marcos blandon gravy leased the plane, one of several aircraft intended to be sent to el salvador.  another single-engine cessna, with registration charlie bravo papa, and an aero commander, were added to the inventory.  according to our source, the aero commander was confiscated from colombian drug traffickers in puerto cabezas a year ago when they were intercepted by sandinist air force (fas) planes.  the planes involved in the operation, however, remained unequipped to fly to el salvador until further notice.

(guevara) how do the five presidents conceive the demobilization of the fmln?  how does the salvadoran government conceive this happening?    (cristiani) i believe there have been substantial changes in this presidential meeting as compared to previous meetings.  to explain this better, marco antonio, we must say we will not fall into what has been used in the past, that is, the famous symmetry.  on this occasion, we have been very clear and categorical when we said that we were not willing to continue contributing sacrifices and other things from the salvadoran government in order to solve the nicaraguan problem exclusively.  we demanded uniformity, and any other country confronting the aggression of an irregular force -- any other country in central america -- also has the right to be treated in a uniform manner, as far as measures and criteria that may be adopted in the presidential meetings.    that is why today for the first time you are seeing how the measures adopted for the nicaraguan resistance -- that had been granted most of the attention up to now -- are also being adopted for the fmln.    we cannot allow a country to claim it is the only target of an aggression by an irregular armed force supported from abroad.  here in el salvador we now have greater evidence following this 11 november terrorist aggression that the fmln is a movement that can survive only with support from abroad, and that it obeys and exists because of international movements.    in the second place, it has demonstrated that it only has the capacity to generate terrorism, which has been mentioned in this document.  we cannot continue just talking about demobilization and pacification in nicaragua.  it is time to apply this to all irregular groups, be it the urng (guatemalan national revolutionary unity) in guatemala, or any other irregular armed group that may come up and may try to hinder the democratic process in the area.    we see this as something that has gone deep into the minds of all the central american presidents, and from now on, we will have greater uniformity in treating all of those irregular groups that operate in the region.    (moderator) rene hurtado of el mundo.    (hurtado) mr president, following the tela and costa del sol meetings, nicaragua has changed its stand.  in costa rica, president ortega was asked if he had sold out the fmln in exchange for the demobilization of the contras and other results of the summit in favor of nicaragua.  i would like to know your opinion about this, and also how you interpret the fact that president ortega has accepted some issues about the fmln that he did not allow in tela or costa del sol? on the other hand, will the demobilization of the fmln be the result of a dialogue or negotiations later on?    (cristiani) in the first place, i believe that daniel ortega was unable to pull any more tricks out of his hat, and he was facing a fact he could no longer hide: he is the one who is spreading armed revolutions in central america and trying to hamper democratic processes in the region.  once more he has been caught not honoring the commitments agreed on in tela, but rather violating these commitments.  on this occasion he has been left with no possible defense.    therefore, in our opinion, he has no option other than to accept the reality of what is happening in central america, or see himself totally isolated amid a peace plan that has international support. this situation would cause him many problems and headaches in political and diplomatic matters.", "entities": [], "gold_templates": [], "pred_relations": [[["Victim: attack", [211, 213], ["attack", 225, 226]], ["Victim: attack", [214, 217], ["attack", 225, 226]], ["PerpInd: attack", [46, 51], ["attack", 225, 226]]], [["PerpInd: attack", [46, 51], ["attack", 40, 41]], ["Victim: attack", [211, 213], ["attack", 40, 41]], ["Victim: attack", [214, 217], ["attack", 40, 41]]], [["Victim: attack", [214, 217], ["attack", 40, 41]], ["PerpInd: attack", [46, 51], ["attack", 40, 41]], ["Victim: attack", [211, 213], ["attack", 40, 41]], ["Victim: attack", [13, 17], ["attack", 40, 41]]], [["Weapon: bombing", [164, 165], ["bombing", 164, 165]], ["Victim: bombing", [95, 97], ["bombing", 164, 165]], ["PerpOrg: bombing", [31, 32], ["bombing", 164, 165]], ["Victim: bombing", [157, 160], ["bombing", 164, 165]]], [["PerpOrg: attack", [31, 32], ["attack", 165, 166]], ["Weapon: attack", [267, 269], ["attack", 165, 166]], ["Victim: attack", [95, 97], ["attack", 165, 166]]]], "pred_templates": [{"incident_type": "attack", "PerpInd": [["group", "of", "10", "paid", "assassins"]], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [["dagoberto", "rodriguez"], ["alfonso", "de", "lima"]], "Weapon": []}, {"incident_type": "attack", "PerpInd": [["group", "of", "10", "paid", "assassins"]], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [["dagoberto", "rodriguez"], ["alfonso", "de", "lima"]], "Weapon": []}, {"incident_type": "attack", "PerpInd": [["group", "of", "10", "paid", "assassins"]], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [["alfonso", "de", "lima"], ["dagoberto", "rodriguez"], ["maria", "elena", "diaz", "perez"]], "Weapon": []}, {"incident_type": "bombing", "PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [["salvadoran"]], "Target": [], "Victim": [["very", "clear"], ["in", "a", "uniform"]], "Weapon": [["as"]]}, {"incident_type": "attack", "PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [["salvadoran"]], "Target": [], "Victim": [["very", "clear"]], "Weapon": [["with", "support"]]}], "pred_trigger_in_text": "the treasury police have informed this network that terrorist ( words indistinct ) alberto chica fernandez , a leader in the ( name indistinct ) labor union , confessed that the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) terrorist leaders may initiate summary actions with a view to purging the leaders of leftist groups because of the failure of the so-called  final offensive to the end .

governments.    these two organizations, together with the tupac amaru movement of peru, founded the american battalion in colombia 5 years ago.  the battalion suffered heavy casualties in colombia and it was believed to have disappeared.  today's communique, however, announced the existence of other organizations forming the american battalion.    they request that the m-19 give them the sword of liberator simon bolivar and recalled their organization's principles and camilo torres' words to the liberator: \"general, as long as your sword lives, the fatherland is not dead.\"    the rebels also state that they back sincere latin american efforts to attain peace for the region and \"find political solutions with the lowest social cost and loss of blood for our people.\"    the international organization told the andean presidents meeting at the galapagos islands that \"today that they have the power,\" they should \"exert it in favor of the people, in favor of a true democracy.\"  however, they criticized \"the murders in streets of caracas,\" the murders in the jails of peru,\" and \"the torture in the jails of ecuador.\"    with regard to the andean leaders, the rebels noted that \"either they are with latin america or they are with the northern tyrants,\" referring to the united states.    the movement states that they have gathered on repression and states that 4,000 union members have been illegally arrested and that 200,000 have \"disappeared.\"    \"the salvadoran people are not alone,\" adds the communique and states that at the request of the people or the farabundo marti national liberation front, we are \"willing to move our men and declare war on the facists' foreign economic interests,\" including \"president (alfredo) cristiani's diplomatic representatives\" in the region.    concluding, the communique states: \"if latin americans have to go with bolivar's sword to san salvador and central america, we will do so.\"    the

meanwhile, the armed forces press committee (coprefa) reported that the bodies of two guerrillas, who were presumably killed during clashes with the army, were found by soldiers in the outskirts of santa tecla, in the central la libertad department.    coprefa reported that two soldiers were killed during a clash with members of the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) in comasagua, about 28 km to the southwest of (san) salvador, where a rebel attack on a coffee processing plant was successfully repelled.    it reported that a civilian was killed in the crossfire and that a soldier was also killed during clashes in zaragoza, south of san salvador, where two guerrillas were wounded.    the military report stated that 10 rebels were wounded in tecoluca, san vicente department, about 60 km east of the capital, during an armed clash between insurgents and the 5th (infantry) brigade, headquartered in that department.    three other soldiers were wounded during an fmln ambush in guazapa, north of (san) salvador, one of the guerrillas' main bastions.    the salvadoran (air) force this morning bombed rebel positions in the outskirts of jucuapa, usulutan department, but no results are yet available, area residents told acan-efe.    the fmln this morning harrassed (army positions stationed near) ayutuxtepeque, north of (san) salvador, without inflicting any casualties.    coprefa also reported that the (armed) forces seized from the guerrillas 500 electric catapults, in the northern (chalatenango) department, which the fmln had used since last year to attack (san) salvador garrisons.    salvadoran (red) cross sources today reported that a 48-year-old woman identified as maria luz lopez was wounded last night when a powerful bomb, which damaged several businesses in (san) salvador, exploded.    the bomb was planted in a heavily commercial area of downtown (san) salvador causing heavy property loses, according to the owners who provided no specific figures.    this is the fourth dynamite attack on businesses in (san) salvador so far in 1990.    the guerrillas intensified their acts of sabotage against the economy, especially

called this news conference to read a foreign ministry communique: (words indistinct) today the panamanian government told luis sandiga cabrera, our charge d'affaires in panama, that he must leave panama in 72 hours.    2.  we have expressed to the panamanian government, through the panamanian charge d'affaires in lima, our surprise and strong protest over that decision.    3.  in view of this decision, the peruvian government has decided to reduce the personnel of its diplomatic mission in panama and to maintain its relations with that country at the first secretary level. peru will in this way continue to fulfill the humanitarian mission of protecting those who have sought asylum in its embassy in panama while the panamanian government issues the safe-conducts that we requested in accordance to the convention on diplomatic asylum signed in caracas on 28 march 1954.    peru is contacting the members of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement (group of eight) to explain the situation and to ask for solidarity and cooperation in overcoming this momentary crisis.    the delicate situation regarding the people at the peruvian embassy has provoked our justified alarm and impelled us to begin talks to ensure that their diplomatic asylum will be respected.  we have talked with the ambassadors from the countries of the permanent mechanism for consultation and political agreement.  i have personally spoken with the ambassadors of venezuela, mexico, and colombia.    i am now ready to answer any questions:    (reporter) mr larco cox, unofficial sources have said that the people in the peruvian embassy in panama are not exactly political refugees but common criminals.  what do you say about this?    (larco cox) the country that grants asylum determines this.  we have been very careful to review each one of them and their files.  we have checked to see if any of them were facing any trials in panama or the united states.  our investigation has revealed that none of them are facing any trials.  the charges were made afterward.  we see this as a result of the emotional climate presently existing in panama.    (reporter) what is your personal opinion of the incident?    (larco cox) it is the diplomatic way to express a protest over what they have been led to believe.  according to panamanian reports, charge d'affaires luis sandiga has made statements on the situation that did not please the government.  the truth is that sandiga has not made any declarations.  however, former ambassador castro arenas is in panama and he has embarked on a campaign in which he is seeking retaliation against the peruvian government.  he could not think of anything better than to point at sandiga as the person responsible for alleged statements.  sandiga has not said a word about the situation because that is not his job.  besides, his car and the car belonging to one of the embassy's military attaches have been stolen; there is no way to begin an investigation.    (reporter) are you saying that former ambassador castro arenas is directly responsible for the situation?    (larco cox) you can make your own conclusions.    (reporter) if the situation deteriorates, will peru recall all of its personnel from panama?    (larco cox) we cannot go to that extreme because we are fulfilling a humanitarian cause, as we said in the communique.  our first responsibility at this time is to see that the right of asylum is respected.  as long as the refugees remain in the embassy, we will maintain our representation at the level of first secretary.

states, where he tried to appear at the congress and the united nations as a statesman aware of his rights.    this is, however, a critical moment for the salvadoran president, and he knows it.  but this point was also stressed by the large numbers of people who booed him at nearly every large u.s.  city he visited.  although the ghosts of the assassinated jesuits shadowed him all during his tour, the arena (nationalist republican alliance) representative, just as his predecessor jose napoleon duarte did, flew to the united states to try to convince the legislators, particularly the democrats, that he intends to resume the dialogue for peace and check the army's criminal aspirations.  waving the human rights flag has been the most important thing for cristiani, particularly because he is aware that with this action he can continue to receive washington's financial support for his government.    according to to some experts, cristiani went farther than his predecessor.  he asked the un secretary general to help in the resumption of talks with the guerrillas, replaced several military officers of doubtful reputation, and assured he will punish severely eight soldiers accused of assassinating the six jesuit priests.  we must keep in mind that, prior to his trip, the salvadoran president succeeded in curbing a coup attempt staged by army reactionary groups. members of the salvadoran opposition have coincided in ther view that never before had a head of state challenged the military hierarchy to such an extent, a hierarchy that opposes all negotiation with the guerrillas.  the experts also said, however, that the country's internal situation has never been so serious.    the rebel offensive launched in november is a landmark, after which everything will be different in el salvador, beginning with the government party, which was left in a very delicate situation in the eyes of influential u.s. power circles.  the guerrilla drive also demonstrated that only two alternatives are left for the country.  if serious peace negotiations are not initiated, the counterinsurgency policy will be aggravated. this could even give the united states a pretext to intervene directly in the country.    although president george bush said he would continue to aid el salvador, a large number of legislators for a long time have been questioning what use has been nearly $4 billion delivered to the salvadoran army in 10 years of war.  if for the white house the alternative is to continue to give military aid to el salvador or resign itself to an eventual victory of the rebels, for cristiani the situation is even more difficult because, to get more money, he must ensure that human rights are respected.  this is equivalent to influencing the most reactionary military officers and guaranteeing the fulfillment of the famous economic recovery plan advocated by his party.  these points are nearly impossible to comply with in a country immersed in war.  if the economy is weak, respect for human rights is even weaker.  anyway, the u.s. government is planning to increase aid for the salvadoran government.  this contributes to putting far into the distance any plans to end the war.", "entities": [{"type": "PerpInd", "start": 227, "end": 229}, {"type": "PerpOrg", "start": 142, "end": 143}], "gold_templates": [{"incident_type": "attack",

(cristiani) i do not think that is the cause of that problem.  we said that the resumption of the talks must take place when the fmln enters the dialogue process with a serious attitude.  we maintain our stance that they must stop all violence that is directly and indirectly affecting civilians, that is, all the terrorist activities the fmln conducts.  this is a small request that obtained the support of all the central american presidents at the san isidro coronado meeting in costa rica.    i think that this is the cause of the problem.  they have asked for changes in format, and we said we had no problem with most of the requests we have received.  we are now waiting for the fmln, since they asked for time to analyze things a little before having the meeting.  we are awaiting the visit of mr. de soto in early march. obviously, the dialogue has not taken place because there are some differences, (words indistinct).  i think the chief difference is that the fmln does not want to agree to stop terrorist actions, and that is why there is no dialogue now.    (moderator) epigmenio ibarra.    (ibarra) mr. president, yesterday in nicaragua, daniel ortega said at a rally that he will wage a constructive opposition.  he said that the revolution did not die with the elections.  he said that the sandinist national liberation front (fsln) will rule from below.  we sense a pretty complex climate for the transition in nicaragua.  what do you think about daniel ortega's statements?  how do you view the possibility that there may be a true transition from power to power instead of a transition of government in nicaragua?    (cristiani) as i have said before, statements by ortega and other representatives of the sandinist front are a source of concern.  they could indicate that the elections may have been very free and honest, but also a farce as far as improving the democratic process is concerned.  the nicaraguan people would be denied the right to freely pick their rulers and the right of these rulers to act as they deem best.  i would say that the nicaraguan revolution belongs not just to the fsln.  the fsln was one of the participants in the revolution in nicaragua against anastasio somoza.  the fact is that a consensus existed among all sectors that supported that revolution.  the fsln has no monopoly on or exclusive control over that revolution.    i believe that in ideological terms there are differences between the views of ms. chamorro and uno (national opposition union), that is, the new government-elect, and the views of the fsln.  yet, the people picked the government.  it is worrisome to hear some statements that the fsln will rule from below.  we believe they would seek to do that by keeping control over the army.  let me repeat: there is nothing democratic about a political party controlling the army.  the army must respond to the government and the country's democratic process, and not to just one political party.  we believe things have not been settled yet.  we believe that there are still many things left pending.

to face a rupture of diplomatic relations with mexico and peru to enforce the law, foreign minister dr. julio e. linares asserted when referring to former collaborators of former general noriega who sought shelter in these embassies several weeks ago.    the mexican embassy in panama city has announced that it has granted diplomatic asylum to rafael arosemena, former manager of the national bank of panama.  however, the panamanian authorities have confirmed that they would not grant him a safeconduct to leave the country, and they sent a note to the mexican embassy urging it to desist from offering him protection.    according to the public prosecutor's office, rafael arosemena is involved in authorizing the payment of checks for $12 million, made out to cash by former colonel marcos justines.  meanwhile, heraclides sucre and gonzalo gonzalez, former majors in the now defunct defense forces, have sought asylum at the peruvian embassy in panama city. they are accused of killing major moises giroldi, who led the foiled coup d'etat against noriega in october 1989.    \"we are willing to pay whatever price is necessary to enforce the law, because these political refugees are common criminals and they have no right to that benefit,\" linares stated when asked by critica libre if panama would be willing to stop the people who have sought asylum at the mexican and peruvian embassies from leaving the country without facing a trial for the crimes they reportedly perpetrated during the previous regime.    linares said that panama will maintain its position of not granting safe-conducts to these refugees, even if the mexican and peruvian government insist on granting them diplomatic asylum, and admitted that this will likely create an international conflict.    nevertheless, linares said that he hopes there will be no need to break diplomatic relations with either of these countries, which insist on keeping former collaborators of former gen noriega as refugees, and he emphasized the need to reach an understanding with these nations.    \"we hope that relations with mexico will not cool off or reach a breaking point given the affection that unites us as free nations,\" linares added.    he revealed that the peruvian embassy sent a note to the panamanian government stating that it will continue to give diplomati protection to the refugees in its embassy, because legal proceedings were started against them after they had been accepted by the diplomatic mission.    \"we are preparing a note of reply to the peruvian government,\" foreign minister linares said.    the following persons are still refugees at the ecuadoran embassy: former public works minister rene bultron, former labor minister cesar martans, former national mortgage bank manager julio shaik, former irhe (institute of hydraulic resources and electrification) director leovigildo herrrera, and former tourism director bernardo dominguez.    last week the foreign minister reviewed the possibility of granting safe-conducts to five of these former officials in the previous regime, provided there is no case pending against them.  according to the official, these refugees face charges for plotting against the state's security, a political crime.    referring to the case of former legislator luis gomez, who sought asylum at the cuban embassy, linares said they will have to make an evaluation.", "entities": [], "gold_templates": [], "pred_relations": [[["Victim: attack", [26, 28], ["attack", 45, 46]], ["Victim: attack", [1, 4], ["attack", 45, 46]]]],

geneva, switzerland.    the armed forces telecommunications instruction center (citfa) reported that a man and a woman were critically wounded when the vehicle in which they were travelling near olocuilta, la paz department, was machinegunned by fmln terrorists on the evening of 4 april.    the wounded are mauricio campos and concepcion herrera, who were taken to a health center by the red cross, the sources added.    the national police reported that two of its agents and a civilian were fired at by terrorists at 1800 on 4 april, as they inspected a car crash between the highway to comalapa airport and 49th south avenue in the montserrat neighborhood.    \"the policemen were machinegunned down by people in a moving vehicle and sustained wounds which have left them in extremely critical condition,\" a security corps spokesman said.    the two agents were assisted by people who repudiated the attack.    a pedestrian, later identified as manuel alvaro mendoza, was also struck by the bullet and he is at rosales hospital.    a military spokesman also reported that a group of persons who identified themselves as fmln-fdr members kidnapped a peasant, jose manuel posada, near la colmena, in el carmen district, cuscatlan department.    meanwhile, 9-year-old yohalmo antonio ortiz was injured by shrapnel when terrorists threw a bomb at civil defense members in nejapa, north of san salvador, while harassing the paramilitary group's outpost. the boy is at bloom hospital.    in the document signed by the government delegation and the fmln-fdr leaders, the latter pledged not to engage in terrorists attacks that might damage assets or injure persons, but \"urban commandos\" or \"terrorists squads\" that operate in san salvador have either not been informed of this resolution or they act independently, the military sources said.    referring to the 2 april car bomb explosion perpetrated in santa tecla, the fmln-fdr claimed responsibility for the attack in a communique, and said that it was \"an action aimed directly at the police\" and that \"they regret the death of a civilian,\" but they did not mention compensation for the relatives.    also, the fmln-fdr claimed responsibility for the attack on general rafael humberto larios's son-in-law, accusing him of being a military pilot -- when in fact he has been a civilian pilot and he was working in a small automobile spare parts distribution company at the time of the attack.    the young man, otto milla, is still in a coma and his pancreas was removed in the latest surgical operation.",

marti, a radio station of the guerrilla group, the casualties were sustained by the armed forces in clashes which occurred on 1 and 2 may and early this morning when several ambushes, attacks, and sabotage aimed at the economy were carried out in several places throughout the country.    radio farabundo marti has reported that the military actions, the largest since the rebel offensive in november 1989, which resulted in thousands of casualties, is part of the \"with the workers and for democracy\" military campaign.    the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln), which does not give details on its casualties, has said that the armed forces sustained 30 casualties in ilobasco, cabanas department, located approximately 55 km from san salvador.    nevertheless, according to military reports issued eight hours after the clashes in that town, the armed forces killed 11 guerrilla members and sustained six casualties.    radio farabundo marti has also reported that the guerrila forces caused 28 army casualties in clashes on 2 may in la laguna, chalatenango department, located approximately 90 km north of san salvador.    the armed forces press committee (coprefa) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  coprefa also reported that 26 houses were damaged.    coprefa also reports that military actions have occurred in cabanas, la libertad, chalatenango, santa ana, la libertad, and san salvador departments during the past two days.  in some places the electrical systems were sabotaged, causing long blackouts.    the guerrilla forces' general command issued a communique in san salvador on 2 may, stating that the military actions are in response to \"the triumphant and arrogant attitude of the government and the military, for the fmln's alleged weakness, which precludes the negotiation process.\"    the communique reasserts their willingness to continue the negotiation process with the government to end a war which has lasted more than a decade.  the negotiation process is being undertaken with the mediation of un secretary general javier perez de cuellar.    perez de cuellar's special envoy, alvaro de soto, arrived in san salvador on 2 may as part of the negotiations.  he met with president alfredo cristiani and the national dialogue commission today, and later he will meet with other leaders.    guillermo ungo, secretary general of the social democratic national revolutionary movement (mnr), told acan-efe that opposition leaders could \"possibly\" meet with fmln delegates in mexico city to learn their views concerning the negotiations.    \"the meeting will have an open agenda so that everyone's position can be heard and so

often experienced setbacks and difficult times. powerful forces are trying to justify violence and war every time diplomatic channels or commitments are not followed or met.    when there is an armed struggle and when thousands are killed on the battlefield, those who promote violence never conclude from those useless killings that war is futile. they do not believe that peace can be achieved through dialogue and negotiation.    it will always be easier to rectify mistakes when the weaknesses are political or when errors are made on the road to peace. we cannot bring the dead back to life, and violence born of hatred takes a long time to heal.    i believe, mr president, that it would be encouraging if you were to rectify some political decisions your government made following the unfortunate incidents at nandaime.  it is important to reopen the communications media that are closed. it is necessary to release the prisoners and to revoke the sentences imposed upon them as punishment for involvement in those incidents.  the peace plan to which we are committed obliges us to restore confidence as soon as possible. our most sacred commitment is to continue progressing on the path toward democratization.    it is imperative that your government and the nicaraguan contras resume negotiations to secure a permanent end to military actions in nicaragua. this could very well be an encouraging example for many central american and other countries. i offer you our costa rican territory for the resumption of such negotiations. i also offer you all the assistance within my means to enable such negotiations to take place.    i understand that you will attend the upcoming inaugural ceremony in ecuador. i believe it would be a sign of confidence in the future of peace, a noble gesture toward rodrigo borja, and would aid in strengthening the ecuadoran democratic process if you attended the ceremony in quito after reversing the setbacks incurred as a result of antidemocratic actions, such as penalizing the communications media and depriving men and women of their liberty.    only if we have the strength to correct our mistakes and the vision to continue on the path outlined in the peace plan can central americans prevent the continuance of the armed aggression against our peoples. a latin american commitment to peace also requires efforts to achieve independence and democracy. we will not be granted another political opportunity to forge history. it is unlikely that there will be a new opportunity for reconciliation to allow today's youth a

noriega's collaborators by mentioning specific names; to convince noriega that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince noriega's panamanian collaborators that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince foreign governments and noriega allies, particularly cuba and nicaragua, that he had lost fdp support and that his government was unsustainable; to convince governments that were hostile to noriega, especially venezuela and colombia, that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince foreign revolutionary movements that dealt with noriega, such as the fmln and the m-19, that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; and to move the anti-noriega sector within the fdp to support specific actions against noriega's regime.    the fdp members, officers, and troops were the targets of this plan.  we see how some were taken in by the psychological operations plan.  the targets of this plan were gen noriega, noriega's panamanian collaborators within the fdp, some civilians, foreign governments that are noriega's allies, foreign governments that are hostile to noriega, and foreign revolutionary organizations that deal with noriega. they identified all of noriega's vulnerabilities, as well as the vulnerabilities of all the targets we have already mentioned.    there were certain themes used in these psychological operations, and the media fell for them many times. this is why we repeatedly asked them not to fall for this misinformation.    these themes included: by imposing his arbitrary nature and corruption, noriega is perverting the fdp and promoting the disintegration of that military institution.  the fdp have become a mafia that is heading toward disgrace. this is a topic that has been discussed in leaflets and many publications.    by disrupting the constitutional order at his whim, noriega is provoking a profound social, economic, and political crisis that is ruining the country. this is done to hide those who are truly responsible for the crisis we are experiencing. the longer noriega remains in power, the more probable becomes a u.s., cuban, or soviet intervention.  the domestic and international conflicts provoked by noriega negatively affect the personal well-being of the fdp members and their families.    noriega's fall is inevitable and the fdp should not fall with him. to save the fdp and the republic of panama, the fdp must remove noriega from office. this is why there were siren songs that an internal coup was under way.    the state security organizations have been following this case for 5 months and we know the fugitives are in the united states. we know where they left from. no one can deny the association of certain u.s. citizens who are involved in this operation with the panamanian groups that were captured.    we have the evidence, the weapons, the instruments used for misinformation, the plans, and the maps with the targets for violence. important people who were going to be kidnapped had also been marked on these maps. they had marked the bridges that were to be destroyed.    gentlemen, we know the power of weapons and we know how to use them.  we know the damage they can do. therefore, before there was a violent confrontation between the panamanian people and their fdp, we went one step ahead of their plans. if arrests were made, it was because we wanted to avoid a confrontation with inexperienced groups that allowed themselves to be used for the personal benefit of those who received, with a siren song, the promise of the panamanian people's $30 million that eric arturo delvalle was going to use for subversive acts, bloody acts to bathe our people in blood, as in the case of the struggle of our brother countries in latin and central america.    we will not permit that. that is why we decided to go one step ahead and foil these plans that have a certain purpose and that would result in mourning and pain for panamanian families.    we have the evidence and those who were arrested were damn well arrested: alberto conte, fred boyd, and all those people who have been working behind the scenes so eduardo herrera and friends can live like kings in the united statets, so they can live their lives drinking champagne and eating pheasant.    eduardo herrera was dismissed from a diplomatic post for smuggling 40 boxes of whiskey per week into israel.  he is the kind of person protected by the pentagon and elliott abrams. he is elliott abrams' hero.    theresa wellington of the (u.s.) embassy in mexico, who gave these people--who left panama for mexico-- their visas in 10 minutes by abrams' orders, has also become one of our people's enemies.

yesterday to el mercurio by fpmr spokesman victor diaz caro, who said that the truce during the plebiscite was to prepare the phase they are now starting.    he also confirmed the statement in brussels this week by fpmr international spokesman marcelo reyes.    diaz caro, who has confessed to being one of the snipers who participated in the attack on president augusto pinochet, is currently under arrest in the santiago prison, and, together with vasily carillo nova, he is national spokesman for one of the factions of this extremist organization.    diaz caro, who was arrested in late 1986 by the police, announced that in \"a matter of hours\" they will start subversive actions. he explained that this new phase of armed struggle will be carried out \"from arica down to magallanes.\"    at the same time he referred to the results of the plebiscite, stating that although they respect those who voted \"no,\" \"the only aspect of the victory of the `no' we accept is that pinochet leave power.\"    in referring to the fpmr's change of strategy, diaz caro disclosed that the decision was made during a meeting of the organization's leaders last april.    of this occasion they discussed the line that the terrorist organization should follow. they also decided to give up the idea of an \"armed rebellion,\" which prevailed until then. the main characteristic of that idea was that the organization served to complement class struggle (as it did in its origin in 1983), to support the people's rebellion to paralyze the country and to perpetrate attacks against the established regime.    diaz caro disclosed that during the meeting they decided to replace the rebellion with the search for a patriotic unity government. he said that \"we realize that ousting the regime is subject to negotiations under a provincial government.\"    according to diaz caro this is when they realized the \"need for a `truce' because they needed to plan greater steps.\"    he added that \"this is when what we call the `national patriotic war' surfaced. the main issue of this war is the armed struggle; we are no longer a mere complement to the people. it represents a qualitative step forward and entails greater responsibilities.\"    diaz caro disclosed that this new phase will require a greater quantity of weapons, more men, and all the support necessary to operate. he said that the months of truce were used to fulfill these needs.    the spokesman added that during the meeting they also decided on the need to establish a non-isolated action.  \"we thought that actions in santiago, concepcion, and valparaiso would be the solution, but that was not the case.\"    diaz caro explained that \"this is why we now realize that the struggle should be carried out from arica down to magallanes, throughout the territory and in various forms.\" (continued)", "entities": [{"type": "PerpInd", "start": 43, "end": 46}, {"type": "PerpInd", "start": 92,

( passage omitted ) there is political weakness , because the armed forces are not given clear missions . we see the actions of the armed forces and the security corps are frustrated , because they spend time , effort , and men capturing terrorists while the government subsequently releases them for humanitarian reasons . i believe the government must apply the laws more forcefully and stop deceiving the population with words such as democratization and with its great political demagogy .

belgium each sent one; for a total of 2,052 tons of aid.    giving a provisional report on the damage, ortega said there were 116 dead, 178 injured, 110 missing, and 29,152 houses destroyed as well as damage to agriculture and fishing.    he stressed the damage to the ecology because thousands of hectares of forest were destroyed. he said that european technicians will travel to nicaragua next week

{"docid": "TST4-MUC4-0069", "doctext": "dear listeners, the minister has arrived and we welcome him and thank him for his participation in this segment. good morning.    (vides) good morning.    (reporter) violence has increased recently and the people are extremely worried. what are the armed forces doing to guarantee the people's welfare?    (vides) the salvadoran people's concern about increased terrorist violence is understandable. we must bear in mind that terrorist acts always escalate when important events are expected. this does not happen only in our country; we recently saw it in seoul, before the olympics, when groups resorted to violence to provoke the authorities and prevent an international event from taking place.    an oas meeting is scheduled to take place in this country in a few days. the event is being threatened by a number of acts, particularly terrorist acts in the san benito, max diaz, escalon, and san francisco neighborhoods.  the terrorists believe the people will protest against the oas meeting if they cause terror in those areas.    we are expecting foreign ministers from latin america, central america, and the united states, whom the terrorists believe will call off the meeting because of the situation in the country. that is the main reason for the increased violence.    you have seen that we have increased patrol operations recently. patrols are also being carried out around the volcanoes near san salvador. security measures are also being implemented on the periphery of san salvador and around the meeting venue, but i cannot give you the details. there is also a complete security plan for the officials who will participate in the oas meeting.    we are ready to reduce the possibility of an incident to a minimum. however, i have always been honest and i must admit there is always the possibility of sabotage or a terrorist act. this does not necessarily mean that it will affect the security measures in the area of the meeting. for example, a blackout can be caused by cutting off an electric line in a distant area.    (reporter) general, the fmln's attacks have not been so overwhelming in the past, yet now those attacks are attaining considerable military success. do the fmln's military actions mean it is superior to the armed forces?    (vides) we cannot conceive their military superiority under any circumstances. i have noticed the guerrilla leaders are currently visiting different countries, particularly the contadora group members. they are trying to gain support for reading a statement at the oas meeting, and they are also trying to pressure the salvadoran government into negotiating with them. this proves the rebels have failed militarily, and that failure has been brought about by our large-scale operations in northern chalatenango department and usulutan department, in the east of the country.    the rebels have tried to bring the war to urban areas.  however, the plans of subversive groups--i showed you the documents on their fire plan in another meeting--did not include the type of terrorist acts that we have seen lately. instead, they planned a general uprising and strike before the elections.    this proves, as i said, that the subversives could not develop their fire plan. they have carried out several acts but they have failed to achieve the expected results.  this is like having a cinema show a movie every day with no-one turning up to see it.    the subversives are trying to carry out this type of event right now to give the impression of military strength, so the oas will pass a resolution recommending negotiation to solve the conflict.    furthermore, the rebels are trying to discredit the democratic process and boycott our next elections because some people are demoralized by terrorism and lack the will to participate in politics, which makes the election results unsatisfactory.

buchi's team will have to resort to until late 1989 and that are now much more dependent than before on the government's political objectives. one option is to keep on doing \"more of the same,\" to ignore the new context that has developed since 5 october, to defuse the monetary time bomb and to apply a tight tourniquet to the economy to prevent renewed outbreaks of higher prices.    the inflation \"bogeyman\" is beginning to make his presence felt (the consumer price index, cpi, is expected to be up 1.3 to 1.5 percent this month), and explanations abound. gerardo aceituno, the head of the forecasting workshop of the labor economy program, attributes the mounting inflationary pressures to the impact of the wage hike and higher international interest rates on domestic prices. he recalls that the prices of farm products have been \"virtually frozen for a year\" and that this explains the huge gap between the wholesale price index, which fell one percent during the past 12 months, and the cpi, which rose 12 percent during the same period. \"the situation could not be sustained, except if businessmen wanted to sacrifice their profit margins, which have so far not been affected, because the vat was cut.\"    juan villarzu, in contrast, places most of the blame for the inflationary pressures on the excessive quantity of money. oddly enough, however, the uncertainty that developed after the victory of the no vote is presumably having an effect somewhat similar to the \"mini-adjustment.\"  he reports that small- and medium-sized businessmen are postponing their investment plans, and thus their demand for credit has fallen off. the dilemma facing them and other \"economic agents\" is whether to spend the money or to deposit it. the central bank comes into play here, because \"not having to compete with the banks, it can begin soaking up some of the money in circulation without boosting interest rates too much. moreover, they are already quite high: 5 percent for 90-day operations, as against 4.2 percent during the first half.\" in addition, it could resort to its sizable monetary reserves and \"burn up\" foreign exchange on higher imports to absorb some of the excess liquidity.  \"i'm thinking about devaluations (of the peso) somewhat similar to the ones this year.\"    options after the no victory    in any event, the large mass of money in circulation and the existing inflationary pressures (whatever their cause) \"constitute an explosive situation,\" which according to villarzu the government will not ignore. because \"if it has any political accomplishment left, it is the victory over inflation.\" and the tightening up will be even more severe if the finance minister insists on achieving a 5-percent rise in the cpi in 1989, as the draft budget sent to the junta calls for. even the central bank regards this goal as dangerous. a high-level central bank executive said that \"it is valid to aim for an inflation rate like that in the developed countries, but we have to be careful because unemployment (which would trigger a heavy concentration of spending) remains high.\"    on the other side of the government's economic card are the already visible and strong pressures that the right has begun to apply so that the government will increase spending in 1989 or at least not reduce it. the right also wants the government to take actions that are more populist in nature or that have less visible effects on voters. significantly, experts on buchi's own team are the ones who are admitting that political demands can be given to some extent without ignoring certain principles.  gaining ground, as a result, are an increase in the minimum wage (\"to pave the way for higher pay in private enterprise\") and further cuts in the vat (the rumor of a cut to 12 percent was already making the rounds before the plebiscite) and in the tax on capital.  but the privatization of enterprises is still strongly supported as well. everything points in the same direction: \"reduce the size of the public and government sector and, at the same time, narrow the maneuvering room on taxes for a government different from this one.\" if it is similar, so much the better.

(villagran) right now, the political and diplomatic commission, on directions from the urng general command, is making every effort to humanize the war situation in the country, especially by showing respect for the geneva agreement, which guatemala signed.    we are doing this because the repressive war the army has been waging against the revolutionary movement and the population has reached levels of extreme cruelty, including indiscriminate bombings and the use of defoliants in conflict zones where civilians live.    there is the particular situation in which neither the guatemalan army nor the government take any war prisoners. this makes us believe that the cruelty used against civilians and people involved in the armed conflict is a violation of human rights.    (martinez) does the urng have any prisoners at this moment?    (villagran) yes. we have sent a note to the national reconciliation commission so it can handle the case of soldier carlos perez lopez, who was captured wounded in the san marcos region, near galvez. he has been given much medical attention. now that he has fully recovered, we are thinking about publicly returning this guatemalan, and we are asking the reconciliation commission to take measures through the international red cross (irc) to receive this man in the framework of the humanization process.    (martinez) will this be the first time the urng will make this kind of contact with the irc?

indications are, indeed, that because time is running short they will start up without much circumspection. to put it more clearly, the presumption is that they will wait until things are under way before trying to put their own mark on the newborn.    christian left (ic) was the first to give this signal. the resolutions of its plenum, made public on 28 october, clearly revealed that it intended to unify the entire left in the formation of the new political entity. in passing, they sent a message to their men who were involved in the ppd (party for democracy): they have to decide between membership in one or the other, but not both.  this is something that mapu (united popular action movement)-barrueto is not addressing with the same earnestness. they apparently seek to take part in every group there is, whether it is called the ppd, cosono (socialist command for the no) or leftist party.    the christian left people went even further. at no time did they conceal their wish that luis maira preside over the new party.    the plenum of the socialist party (ps)-almeyda was, of course, the most eagerly anticipated. as on other occasions, it was supposed to set the tone for the jockeying by the left. they ambitiously felt that this was the opportunity to remove some strategic obstacles, sort of like killing two birds with one stone: registration and the sought-after socialist unity.    perhaps this is why they held their plenum, where on 28 and 29 october they discussed the advantages of registering their own party, in other words, responding once and for all to the initiatives of the nunezes, who took over the ppd, the only legally recognized socialist group.  others thought that it would be wiser to promote a party in the \"socialist space,\" bring together there christian left, mapu-barrueto and the small socialist groups that still exist, in other words, cosono as a party. this stand obviously gave priority to something of a leading political role and kept the pc at a distance.    the option of registering a broad left-wing group was also raised at the plenum; to many this entailed a certain \"sacrifice\" of predominance by the socialists.    the ps-almeyda ultimately opted for a \"consensus\" vote, of whose public version there were several interpretations.  there was talk of \"the registration of a legal instrument representative of the socialist space at the disposal of the grassroots forces and of the progressive and leftist independents who have so far belonged to unlegalized parties.\" the intention of the socialist language was clear, but the party did not close ranks with a broad left-wing alliance. the emphasis was in the eye of the beholder.    what was not made public was that the political vote of \"the more than 50 and fewer than 100 participants\" spoke of giving priority to socialist leadership in the new party. the negotiations are now focusing on this.

year, the nation has been discussing peace in a way seldom heard of before. all colombians, including illustrious former presidents, the media, the catholic church, political parties, the rebels, and the nation at large, have been voicing their strong desire for reconciliation in the homeland.    we rebels have always regarded peace highly. this is why we have always clearly reiterated this idea. to set the proper frame of mind, we will recall what was said in the la uribe agreement on 28 march 1984:    \"to ensure peace in the nation--which is an essential prerequisite for the colombian people's prosperity--and social and economic development based on liberty and justice, the following is hereby agreed upon.    \"1. the farc and ep (poor people's army) will order a cease-fire and the suspension of all military operations in all fronts throughout the country as of 0000 on 28 may 1984.    \"2. the farc and ep will again condemn and not allow kidnappings, extortion, and terrorism in all their forms.  farc-ep will help eliminate these practices because they are an attack on liberty and human dignity.\"    in addition, the m-19 and epl (people's liberation army) reached the following agreement with the government: \"... we believe the cessation of armed clashes between government forces and the rebels is an essential requirement to lay the groundwork for the political, economic, and social reforms that the colombian people need and desire. taking into account the highest interests of the homeland, the government and the rebels have reached the following agreement: the negotiation and dialogue commission, the epl general command, and the m-19 high command have agreed on a cease-fire. once this is carried out, a great national dialogue will begin, develop, and conclude. through this dialogue, all social and political sectors will be able to express their willingness to search for peace based on social justice.    \"consequently, the epl general command and the m-19 high command hereby order all fronts, columns, and units to cease firing and suspend all military operations as of 1300 on 30 august.\"    the spirit and the letter of these accords is now worth considering. there was a time when colombians said these accords between the government and the rebels had become the country's new political philosophy.    this is not the time for useless recriminations, but for a serious effort to determine who is to blame because the accords went partially unfulfilled. anyway, considering these accords will not harm the government's policy. we hereby reaffirm our willingness to talk with your government to find a political solution to the country's problems.  this willingness to talk is shared by all of the members of the simon bolivar guerrilla coordinating board and is part of the conclusions reached by three guerrilla summit meetings.    we fully agree with the peace proposal presented by senator alberto leyva duran. we find it clear, simple, understandable, and complete. this is why we wrote this letter, made our latest statements, and have given instructions for a unilateral cease-fire as the best christmas gift for our people.
