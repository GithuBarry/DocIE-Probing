made by the 19 april movement (m-19) of colombia and alvaro lives, dammit! of ecuador to sign peace and democracy agreements with their respective governments.    these two organizations, together with the tupac amaru movement of peru, founded the american battalion in colombia 5 years ago.  the battalion suffered heavy casualties in colombia and it was believed to have disappeared.  today's communique, however, announced the existence of other organizations forming the american battalion.    they request that the m-19 give them the sword of liberator simon bolivar and recalled their organization's principles and camilo torres' words to the liberator: \"general, as long as your sword lives, the fatherland is not dead.\"    the rebels also state that they back sincere latin american efforts to attain peace for the region and \"find political solutions with the lowest social cost and loss of blood for our people.\"    the international organization told the andean presidents meeting at the galapagos islands that \"today that they have the power,\" they should \"exert it in favor of the people, in favor of a true democracy.\"  however, they criticized \"the murders in streets of caracas,\" the murders in the jails of peru,\" and \"the torture in the jails of ecuador.\"    with regard to the andean leaders, the rebels noted that \"either they are with latin america or they are with the northern tyrants,\" referring to the united states.    the movement states that they have gathered on repression and states that 4,000 union members have been

democratic front) terrorist groups have continued their treacherous attacks against civilians and police officers in the capital and throughout the countryside, openly ignoring the agreements reached by their leaders with a government delegation in geneva, switzerland.    the armed forces telecommunications instruction center (citfa) reported that a man and a woman were critically wounded when the vehicle in which they were travelling near olocuilta, la paz department, was machinegunned by fmln terrorists on the evening of 4 april.    the wounded are mauricio campos and concepcion herrera, who were taken to a health center by the red cross, the sources added.    the national police reported that two of its agents and a civilian were fired at by terrorists at 1800 on 4 april, as they inspected a car crash between the highway to comalapa airport and 49th south avenue in the montserrat neighborhood.    \"the policemen were machinegunned down by people in a moving vehicle and sustained wounds which have left them in extremely critical condition,\" a security corps spokesman said.    the two agents were assisted by people who repudiated the attack.    a pedestrian, later identified as manuel alvaro mendoza, was also struck by the bullet and he is at rosales hospital.    a military spokesman also reported that a group of persons who identified themselves as fmln-fdr members kidnapped a peasant, jose manuel posada, near la colmena, in el carmen district, cuscatlan department.    meanwhile, 9-year-old yohalmo antonio ortiz was injured by shrapnel when terrorists threw a bomb at civil defense members in nejapa, north of san salvador, while harassing the paramilitary group's outpost. the boy is at bloom hospital.    in the document signed by the government delegation and the fmln-fdr leaders, the latter pledged not to engage in terrorists attacks that might damage assets or injure persons, but \"urban commandos\" or \"terrorists squads\" that operate in san salvador have either not been informed of this resolution or they act independently, the military sources said.    referring to the 2 april car bomb explosion perpetrated in santa tecla, the fmln-fdr claimed responsibility for the attack in a communique, and said that it was \"an action aimed directly at the police\" and that \"they regret the death of a civilian,\" but they did not mention compensation for the relatives.    also, the fmln-fdr claimed responsibility for the attack on general rafael humberto larios's son-in-law, accusing him of being a military pilot -- when in fact he has been a civilian pilot and he was working in a small automobile spare parts distribution company at the time of the attack.    the young man, otto milla, is still in a coma and his pancreas was removed in the latest surgical operation.", "entities": [{"type": "PerpInd", "start": 84, "end": 86}, {"type": "PerpOrg", "start": 84, "end": 85}, {"type": "Target", "start": 68, "end": 69},

barco vargas concerning the murder of mr.  carlos pizarro leongomez.  the message reads as follows:    carlos pizarro's murder is a monstrous crime that has cut short the life of a man who had shown his will for peace and his commitment to colombia.  the crime was directed at hindering the development of the electoral process and destroying the reconciliation process that the government and m-19 (19 april movement) carefully constructed, surpassing many obstacles.  in this case, as in many others, this painful tragedy should serve to consolidate the ideals of peace and pluralism for which so many colombians have struggled -- one of them, carlos pizarro.  it should serve to reassert our repudiation of violence and our faith in democratic procedures.    further on the president's message notes:    pizarro's relatives and his followers know that the government, and i personally, feel strong wrath and sadness, but we will not be discouraged.  we will uphold the banners of reconciliation, pluralism, and the right to freely and peacefully express any idea.  we will also continue to unmask and combat enemies of peace.    the president adds in his message:    i interpret the desire of all colombians who admired carlos pizarro's democratic vocation, by warning those who are responsible for this tragic murder that they will not manage to destroy what has been worked for so hard and with the support of political forces and the people who voted for peace on 11 march to open a road for peace that is clear, possible, and defined.    the president's message continues:    you know that during this peace process, many enemies and difficulties were surpassed, but none has been so large as this tragedy that has shaken all colombians.  the obligation that lies before us is to keep open the road to peace that the murderers of carlos pizarro want to destroy.  article 95 of the electoral code indicates that when a presidential candidate dies, another person in his own movement has the right to take his place.  in compliance with this norm, the government will offer every facility for the registry of a new m-19 presidential candidate, so that he can continue to hoist the flags of peace and pluralism as is proper for a democratic debate.    the president also says in his message:    i have asked the government minister and the peace adviser to meet as soon as possible with m-19 representatives so that together they may study alternatives to confront such a serious situation. as soon as possible, the government minister will also direct contacts with the rest of the political forces to request their opinions about the present situation and to continue to give all the necessary guarantees so that the electoral process may develop according to what is established in the constitution and our laws.    the message ends:    i invite all colombians who are tired of so much violence to come to the polls in the next elections and vote for peace and pluralism. i invite all political and social forces to join in solidarity with the electoral process and defend the institutions that are threatened by violence.  it is time for good sense and prudence.  it is time to rise to the occasion and show our commitment to democracy.    this is the text of president virgilio barco's message on the murder mr. carlos pizarro leongomez.", "entities":

(ismael orozco, public works director for the 5th district) well, after initial talks with ecopetrol (colombian petroleum enterprise) technicians today, beginning at 1700, after the fire is under control, they will begin restoring service on the oil pipeline.

(begin recording) (gracia) ecopetrol has lost 95 billion pesos in revenues this year due to the 44 terrorist attacks on the cano limon - covenas oil pipeline. in these attacks, 13.2 million barrels of crude oil have been lost. the areas most affected by these attacks are in sucre, arauca, norte de santander, and santander departments.    (reporter alvaro ayala) doctor, could these terrorist attacks lead to an increase in fuel prices in colombia?    (dr andres restrepo londono, president of ecopetrol) obviously, there will come a time when, faced with increasing internal production costs and falling revenues, we are going to have to consider compensating our losses with an increase in domestic oil prices, but that is a measure we are not about to adopt at this time.    (gracia) today's landslide, which destroyed a section of the multipurpose pipeline between barrancabermeja and bucaramanga, has resulted in estimated losses totalling 1.435 billion pesos.

of the southern city of ayacucho.    a peasant defense patrol unit was combing the area in search of guerrillas when it was ambushed on 22 november, the newspaper expreso reported today.    the wave of violence has hit peruvian tourist establishments in the city of huaraz, capital of the ancash department, where four inns and hotels were bombed last night, damaging the buildings and injuring an 18 year-old girl.    in cusco, 1,000 km southeast of lima, a bus (as received) heading toward machu pichu went out of control as the result of sabotage and fell into a 60-meter ravine. the wives of the jersey city, united states, and cusco mayors died in this accident.    leftist senator enrique bernales ballesteros, president of the special commission for the investigation and study of terrorism and violence, has noted that the escalation of violence has claimed the lives of 21 people per day during the month of november. he said that the increased violence can be traced to actions by the terrorist groups shining path and tupac amaru revolutionary movement (mrta). these attacks were repressed by the forces of order.    senator bernales reported that 630 people were killed in violent acts in november and that 1,775 have been killed over the past 12 months.    bernales said that 403 people were killed in november as a result of violent acts, including 147 civilians, 165 presumed terrorists, 65 armed forces members, and 26 drug traffickers. a total of 227 people were killed in urban violent acts.    senator bernales added that a total of nearly 13,000 people have been killed since the terrorist violence began in 1980.    bernales expressed his concern over the fact that 67 percent of the people killed in violent acts involved youths who were between 15 and 29 years of age. he asked the government to establish guidelines to counter this social phenomenon.    amid this bloody and destructive situation, the peruvian episcopal conference has made a christmas appeal, asking that--without ignoring \"the seriousness of the situation\"--for a truce \"for peace, reconciliation, and tranquillity\" to prevail in the country.    the bishops said: \"recalling he who prevailed over death, we call upon those who have resorted to violence and killings as a solution to the evils of society, to allow the citizens for whom they claim to struggle to live like brothers.\"", "entities": [{"type": "PerpInd", "start": 0, "end": 5}, {"type": "PerpOrg", "start": 1, "end": 3}, {"type": "PerpInd", "start": 203, "end": 205}, {"type": "PerpOrg", "start": 208, "end":
