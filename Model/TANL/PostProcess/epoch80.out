trigger_output_sentence on 30 november when u.s. president bush set forth to malta to meet with soviet leader gorbachev , a report from angola said that a central intelligence agency ( cia ) airplane on a clandestine mission of delivering weapons to the antigovernment national union for the total independence of angola ( unita ) crashed in southern angola on 27 november and that the four americans on the plane were killed . today both the u.s. state department and the defense department confirmed the crash , but they refused to comment on whether the americans who were killed were cia officials , or on the nature of the plane 's mission . this is in sharp contrast to the response that the u.s. government made a few days ago in connection with a plane crash in el salvador . after a plane carrying weapons to the salvadoran guerrillas crashed on 25 november , u.s. secretary of state baker promptly instructed the undersecretary of state on that same evening to summon the soviet ambassador to the united states to protest to the soviet union for undermining peace in central america and  failing to exercise its influence '' to stop cuba and nicaragua from delivering weapons to the guerrillas in el salvador . in this connection , a u.s. government official pointed out that president bush would present the central america issue as an important issue while discussing problems of regional conflicts with soviet leaders during their mediterranean meeting . some officials even said that the central america issue is the  principal obstacle '' to the improvement of u.s.-soviet relations , and that only when the ussr makes further concessions on the central america issue will it be possible for the united states to provide economic assistance to the soviet union . in a ceasefire accord signed on 24 june this year , unita and the angolan government agreed to seek ways and means to conclude the civil war that had gone on for 14 years . however , the u.s. government keeps supplying weapons to unita . according to u.s. officials
trigger_output_sentence as a latin american president , i feel a little bit uncomfortable over the statement that the north americans are victims of the drugs produced in latin america and that colombia , peru , and bolivia are to blame for producing the drugs ; let 's call those countries to talk with them . that seems to me a very ethnocentric vision ; it looks at this matter from only one side . our peasants are poor people who produce whatever is most profitable , and coca cultivation happens to be most profitable for them . this is so , speaking coldly , honestly , and sincerely . as president of peru i have to point out that my people , the huallage region peasants , can not be considered as criminals or as people who must be jailed for producing coca leaves . we have exchanged these views with president barco , and we reached these conclusions . we must also note that this matter has been handled with a great deal of publicity . after the death of carlos galan , a great colombian leader , the colombian government launched an offensive intended to find out whether the drug trafficking bands were responsible for his assassination , and the u.s. government then extended some assistance . this assistance has been present to the world as though the united states had sent an enormous quantity of aircraft , hundreds of helicopters , and thousands of millions of dollars to colombia . as i was able to see in bogota , only helicopters , some of which had been purchased earlier by the colombian government , were sent . i was also informed that some of those helicopters had been used previously in peru . i have said that , if there is that much conviction , i support president bush for defending u.s. society . if he has that much conviction , it is hard to believe that less than one thousandth of what is spent in arms and military expenditures should be allocated to replace coca plantations and to improve the general situation in latin america . we have talked with president barco , and i will talk with president paz zamora , who will tomorrow

trigger_output_sentence i believe that the climate of flexibility is embracing the entire political , military , and economic world system and that the banks will have to be content with collecting less than what they originally thought . there was a triumphant presentation of an offer to reduce a country 's debt by up to 20 percent , but as far as we know that offer has not materialized . furthermore , a 20-percent reduction is not significant , not great enough to solve the problems of poverty and the financial obligations of latin america . the reduction must be much greater . a reduction of 10 or 20 percent will do little ; everything will remain the same . we believe -- and i have been saying this to every latin american president -- that only through our adoption of firm and dignified positions will the adversary relent . ( passage omitted ) ( garcia ) let me now say a few words about a different subject , the establishment of relations with north korea . i believe the opposition has raised a tempest in a teacup ; it has raised an issue that is of no relevance to the peruvian people . first , we uphold the concept of universality of relations , of maintaining relations with all nations . colombian president virgilio barco established relations with north korea a few months ago ; he did not have to face a savage opposition telling him that he was throwing himself into the arms of terrorism . nobody has complained to carlos andres perez or to salinas de gortari about maintaining relations with north korea . for that matter , nobody has objected in bolivia , austria , or sweden , because in those countries there is no reactionary right to argue that to recognize north korea is to court destruction . second , someone -- and i do not want to mention him by name -- has said that relations have been established with a terrorist state . this is a tremendous error , because 20,000 rifles sold to us by north korea at $ 90 apiece -- $ 10 less than anywhere in the world -- have made it possible to save and defend the country even better

'' nevertheless , in a statement given later to the media , the auxiliary bishop emphasized that the implicated military  do not represent isolated cases of persons who violated the norms of an institution , but are actually part of a formation and thought scheme according to which the defense of human rights is something subversive .

( guevara ) how do the five presidents conceive the demobilization of the fmln ? how does the salvadoran government conceive this happening ? ( cristiani ) i believe there have been substantial changes in this presidential meeting as compared to previous meetings . to explain this better , marco antonio , we must say we will not fall into what has been used in the past , that is , the famous symmetry . on this occasion , we have been very clear and categorical when we said that we were not willing to continue contributing sacrifices and other things from the salvadoran government in order to solve the nicaraguan problem exclusively . we demanded uniformity , and any other country confronting the aggression of an irregular force -- any other country in central america -- also has the right to be treated in a uniform manner , as far as measures and criteria that may be adopted in the presidential meetings . that is why today for the first time you are seeing how the measures adopted for the nicaraguan resistance -- that had been granted most of the attention up to now -- are also being adopted for the fmln . we can not allow a country to claim it is the only target of an aggression by an irregular armed force supported from abroad . here in el salvador we now have greater evidence following this 11 november terrorist aggression that the fmln is a movement that can survive only with support from abroad , and that it obeys and exists because of international movements . in the second place , it has demonstrated that it only has the capacity to generate terrorism , which has been mentioned in this document . we can not continue just talking about demobilization and pacification in nicaragua . it is time to apply this to all irregular groups , be it the urng ( guatemalan national revolutionary unity ) in guatemala , or any other irregular armed group that may come up and may try to hinder the democratic process in the area . we see this as something that has gone deep in the
trigger_output_sentence comrades : a new element that we must analyze and explain emerged at the conclusion of the central american presidents ' emergency meeting . let us see first why the meeting took place . the main reason is the very complicated predicament in which our offensive has placed cristiani and the high command . as you will remember , the government has met with much international disrepute and isolation because of the brutal assassination of jesuit priests and the bombing of the civilian population . let us recall , as a significant fact , that the united nations has condemned the government because of all it has done , especially because of the latest atrocities . on that occasion , el salvador was the only country that voted against that resolution while 96 countries voted in favor . we mention this case as a most significant one , but the fact is that there has been so much worldwide condemnation that the dictatorship has found itself in a really desperate situation . this was a cause of concern for the north americans . to whom could they turn at a time when all international organizations had turned their backs on cristiani ? the north americans had to resort to some forum that would not condemn the genocidal regime and that , on the contrary , would provide support in spite of all the atrocities the regime has committed . the most suitable idea was to promote an emergency meeting of central american presidents , because in central america , as we all know , the north americans have had their backyard and most of these countries serve their interests . the meeting was called to try to pull cristiani out of international isolation . under what conditions did summit take place ? we have to say first that the presidents of el salvador and costa rica , and probably of guatemala , had reached an agreement prior to the meeting . the subject of the discussion was a document drafted by arias and cerezo . this document expressed support for cristiani from the very beginning . joseph sullivan , a u.s. state department official in charge of latin american affairs , as well as other u.s. state department officials , such as the one published in the

trigger_output_sentence fellow countrymen : i am addressing you after our country has begun to overcome , with effort and tenacity , the first obstacles of a serious crisis , the future implications and repercussions of which we still do not know . i therefore wanted to convey a message of hope and encouragement to every chilean , to show them my feelings at this time of deep reflection . from the very moment i learned about this terrorist economic aggression , i ordered the creation of four ministerial commissions to tackle the problem . i also sent two ministers to the united states to meet with u.s. government officials . after tiring sessions of talks , these ministers managed to overcome a substantial part of the grape problem . the problem affecting other fruits remains to be solved . this new attack against the chilean nation , an attack that destiny has placed in the nation 's path of freedom , progress , and well-being , compels us to close ranks behind the government , unified and ready to fight -- with courage and high spirit -- the problem that faces us . on this occasion the country has seen how the countless threats to boycott the national economy have worked . most of the time such threats have been promoted by certain politicians , labor leaders , or communist labor unions , both at home and abroad . they are the ones who -- driven by personal or ideological interest -- have continually jeopardized the stability of workers , of families , and of those whom they demagogically call their fellow countrymen . they do not care if they cause unemployment , poverty , and hunger to 500,000 fellow citizens who work in this agricultural activity . how shamelessly they make claims and demands , offering their support and their solidarity when chile is seriously threatened ! yet when the danger is over , they change their attitude and again level charges against the government and criticize its actions . in doing that they fail to recall that from its very beginning the chilean nation has been built upon non-negotiable principles because they are the essence of the national soul . gentlemen : our will is based on our feeling of unity in the face of adversity , whether from the action of nature or from the 
trigger_output_sentence dear radio audience : first of all , i want to thank you for allowing me to talk to you tonight about a very important issue for the future of our country . many times you have heard us mention the word solidarity . we have always used it as a word that means to think about those who suffer the most , those who have less . indeed , those are the people we must help , even with our own sacrifice , and many times with a huge sacrifice by all of us . if love is the bond that unites family members , solidarity should be the great pillar , the cement that unites salvadoran society , so that , united , we may fulfill our desire for peace , tranquility , happiness , and well-being . however , tonight allow me to give you two examples of what we consider should be the use of the word solidarity and what this word means in matters that are completely different from one another . a few weeks ago the government was forced , due to an increase in oil prices , to raise the price of oil byproducts such as gasoline , diesel , and all fuels . in the past , the government subsidized gasoline . perhaps the government did this to make people believe this would have nothing but positive effects . however , let us analyze for a while the issue of increases in the price of fuel . when a government has no money for subsidizing , that means the cost of living will go up . there is no doubt that prices will rise when a government spends more than what it has . however , let us see how this aspect , or rather the principle of solidarity , applies to the increase in fuel prices , especially the price of gasoline . ten percent of all families in our country own a vehicle . in general , that 10 percent are those who have the most ; in other words , those who have the possibility of buying a car , a vehicle . if we subsidized gasoline , what we would be doing is taking money out of a government that , for the time being , does not have such funds available . in order to get such funds , the government would have to impose new taxes which would affect all salvadorans . a san

trigger_output_sentence regarding the jesuits ' case , the fmln states that : 1. the fmln and several sectors , including young armed forces officers , were right in pointing to the army as being responsible for this horrible crime . the responsibility of the armed institution for this case and the cases involving fenastras ( salvadoran workers national union federation ) , monsignor romero , the nuns , and the u.s. agrarian experts , as well as for the bombings in the cities and massacres in the rural sector , show that we were right when we mentioned in our last peace proposal the need to clean up the army and reform the judicial system . 2. to advance in the country 's democratization , it is not enough to solve this case . the other cases need to be solved and those guilty for them should be punished . the establishment of responsibilities can not remain at the level of officers and troops who only carried out orders . most important is to establish responsibility among higher-ranking officers because a decision of this sort could not be beyond the responsibility of the top command . 3. it is also necessary to comply with the esquipulas ii agreements concerning democratization ; reforming the judicial system ; lifting the state of emergency ; reestablishing freedom of expression , mobilization , and organization ; releasing the more than 3,000 political prisoners ; and stopping the repression against the church and other sectors . 4. the announcement by cristiani is an effort to resolve complicated discussions on u.s. aid for el salvador and to continue to benefit from this aid to maintain the war . it would be a mistake to increase aid to the salvadoran army because of this announcement or because the case may be resolved . such aid would leave open the possibility of seeing a case like that of the jesuit priests happening again . the best way to contribute to a negotiated solution is to cease aid . we appeal to the u.s. congress to make this decision . if this is done , the fmln would commit itself to making efforts to reach an immediate ceasefire . 5. favorable conditions for negotiations depend on justice-making
trigger_output_sentence according to the military intelligence services , the farc ( revolutionary armed forces of colombia ) launched a new offensive to recover the region of middle magdalena that was lost to gonzalo rodriguez gacha and his men 5 years ago . this is the reason for fierce fighting there between the army and several farc fronts during the first few days of this year . heavily armed and strengthened these fronts are trying to militarily take over areas that rodriguez gacha 's deputies have been vacating because of the crisis created in their organization by the death of el mejicano ( gonzalo rodriguez ' alias ) . the authorities believe that the return to the strategy of using kidnappings as a means to finance itself is also part of this new offensive that seems to be enjoying the support of other guerrilla groups such as the epl ( popular liberation army ) . meanwhile , in la uribe the farc general secretariat has submitted another peace proposal to president barco . the guerrilla group states that it is willing to establish a new political party called bolivarian reunion of the people ( reunion bolivariana del pueblo ) if the government calls a plesbicite to establish a national constituent assembly . the proposal was received on 9 january directly from the hands of farc leaders by members of the presidential advisory board for peace issues .

trigger_output_sentence the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) has described the arrest of five soldiers accused of committing the massacre ( of six jesuit priests ) as  a manipulated cover operation . '' basically , cristiani is alleged to have decided to punish a number of low-ranking officers to close the case as quickly as possible and to end international pressures . what is your opinion in this regard ? ( zamora ) the fact that president cristiani acknowledges that members of the army were responsible for the massacre is a first step and definitely a good thing , but it is entirely insufficient unless the subsequent steps are also taken . first , to identify who the responsible parties were : this is the first important point , because nobody can feel satisfied if only low-ranking officers are identified . such an act can only have been ordered by high-ranking officers . we must not forget the [ murder | attack ] of monsignor romero , for which there were no sentences and no trials . ( oppes ) however , the armed forces high command immediately denied involvement in the operation , stating that it was an isolated action  divorced from any institutional policy .

trigger_output_sentence ... to an arrested leader of the tupac amaru revolutionary movement mean that the government has engaged in a dialogue with that group ? ( garcia ) things should be properly clarified because one should not be influenced by reports or anecdotes . there is an essential fact : a hard blow has been dealt to subversion with the arrest of one of its principal chieftains -- not a leader but a chieftain . peru has been the target of bloody terrorist attacks . there can be no concessions for terrorists other than those granted by the law . this fact can not be dispelled by an anecdote like the one i read in the newspapers today . the essential fact is that this arrest ( of victor polay campos ) is a major blow to subversion . it was not merely good luck , but it was the result of work and follow-up by the intelligence services of the armed forces and the police . i believe this is the key point . i have seen that attention has been given to a visit ( paid by prime minister armando villanueva to polay campos in prison ) which was neither a courtesy visit nor an expression of support , but just a supervisory act , given the importance of the facts . another objective of the visit , which for sure has already been commented on by some communist politicians , was to observe the condition of the detainee . the visit did not mean that the detainee was granted special status . we do not grant special status to anyone , much less to these murderers who have stained the nation with blood . the full weight of the law must be strictly enforced on these individuals . consequently , the visit by prime minister armando villanueva to the antiterrorist directorate does not mean that a dialogue has begun or that someone is being praised , as some ill-intentioned mass media will probably say .

trigger_output_sentence far from achieving a truce the day the recent presidential elections were held , a general increase in violence throughout the entire country was the result of the civil war in which the united states and the military have submerged el salvador for the past 9 years . on the one hand there was the militarization of the elections themselves and the indiscriminate bombing and machinegunning of the civilian population , which left a toll of hundreds of victims as well as three newsmen murdered by army members . on the other hand there were military actions by the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) , which , among other things , inflicted 150 casualties on the army and brought 90 percent of traffic to a standstill . the voting statistics paint a similar picture : in 29 of the 262 municipalities in which the country is divided , there was no voting at all . of the 2.2 million salvadorans who should be on the voting lists , only 1.8 million were registered , and while 60 percent of the voters showed up at the polls for the 1984 elections , this figure was completely inverted this past 19 march . today -- just like before the balloting began -- peace , democracy , and social harmony in el salvador ( will not be reached ) as long as the united states and the army continue to usurp the power formally represented by a civilian government , and any presidential elections -- in addition to yielding another farce similar to the one that has just been staged -- will only result in an atmosphere of violence that might extend even further and reach even bloodier proportions . if , on the contrary , those who really hold power were interested in a negotiated , peaceful solution to the salvadoran conflict , they would at least be taking the first serious steps to meet with the other belligerent force : the fmln . for the time being , however , the new electoral farce has accomplished nothing but to provide overwhelming proof that it is entirely unviable and ineffective .

trigger_output_sentence political life in colombia is still linked with violence ... .. ( cepeda ) colombia is experiencing an extremely severe political and institutional crisis , caused by the incompatibility between the fast developing productive forces and the existing political setup . for example , last year colombia 's economic growth was 4.5 percent . however , political life continues to be dominated by the two old parties -- the liberals and the conservatives , who maintain a merely formal democracy . we should not forget colombia 's strategic position : it forms a bridge between central and south america . all events in colombia affect the neighboring countries . precisely because of this , the so-called  santa fe-2 '' document , drawn up by extreme right-wing u.s. politicians , contains a plan to apply pressure in colombia and , more specifically , to expand the so-called low-intensity conflict , one of whose manifestations is the so-called  dirty war '' in the country . accordingly , the violence in colombia is caused by both internal factors -- the crisis of the institutions -- and external ones , namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the united states .
