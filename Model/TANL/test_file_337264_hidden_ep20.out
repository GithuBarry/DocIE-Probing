trigger_output_sentence 1. during the years of dictatorship , chilean foreign relations were divided into two processes . on the one hand , as the dictatorship became more and more isolated , it was increasingly condemned in international fora and repudiated by international public opinion . on the other hand , as more and more countries and organizations expressed their support for a free chile and generously granted their solidarity to our cause , our organizations and democratic parties became increasingly open to the world . thus , they expanded their horizons and contributed their experiences . 2. during this period , the party has substantially strengthened its international relations and enhanced its vision of the international situation . it has strengthened its ties with the latin american peoples ' revolutionary and democratic cause , and it has fully immersed itself in the great debates of world socialism . to these debates we brought our views on a profoundly renewed leftist socialism committed to democracy , development , and social change . 3. our relations with the parties that make up the international socialist ( si ) and with the si organization itself have been enriched within this context . this strengthening of ties has been the result of two things . first , it is based on the position that in compliance with its principles the si has upheld regarding the chilean situation . in october 1973 , a few days after the coup , si chairman willy brandt condemned the end of the chilean democracy and president allende 's [ assassination | attack ] at the un general assembly . at the time he also said this was a great step backward for those who aspired to achieve socialism through democratic means . since then , the si has been permanently mobilized in favor of chile by making the chilean cause and salvador allende the symbols of all international struggle for democracy and change . it is within this framework of interest and cooperation that the voice of chilean socialism has been heard and our ideas and proposals praised . 4. the second reason stems from the process of expansion and transformation experienced by the si in the past 2 decades . the overall process of change that took place in the world during this period -- the technological revolution , the growing interdependence among nations , and the

trigger_output_sentence colonel rene emilio ponce , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said today that the offensive launched on 26 september by the farabundo marti national liberation front , fmln , was a mistaken step taken by the rebels within the context of the dialogue process with the government , which was resumed in mexico . col ponce said that with this attitude the rebels are not showing a real desire for peace , and he described it as a propagandistic action . today , during his tour of various areas of conflict , col ponce said that recent fmln attacks on various military positions as part of its latest campaign following the unilateral truce was a serious mistake on the part of the rebel commanders , as they have been carried out in the midst of a dialogue between the rebels and the government , which has been described as continuous . ( begin recording ) ( ponce ) that shows there are , on the one hand , the proposals and what the terrorist leaders call their desire for peace , and , on the other hand , the real actions . i think that the campaign the fmln has mounted nationwide was a bad step , because it does not show a real and sincere desire to seek peace in our country . ( end recording ) colonel ponce added that the request for reducing the number of troops as stated in the guerrilla proposal is a political move . he played down the latest rebel offer presented to the government in mexico .

trigger_output_sentence such an unconditional cease-fire does not correspond to the spirit of the esquipulas and tela agreements and the accords the government and the fmln signed in mexico in which the sides clearly agreed to find solutions in the area and in el salvador . asking for an end to the war and negotiations is like demanding that the situation be changed without having won the war . in addition to being unrealistic , this is a formula for not negotiating and continuing the war . in the esquipulas ii documents , the governments urge the sides to agree to a cease-fire . the tela accords also appeal to the salvadoran government to reach an agreement with the fmln in the spirit of the esquipulas ii accords . this particular agreement links the cessation of hostilities to democratization , social justice , and self-determination as a harmonious , indivisible whole . this concept is supported by the un security council in its resolution 637 of 27 july 1989. in addition , the first paragraph of the mexican accord reads as follows : the salvadoran government and the fmln will talk in an effort to reach an understanding through negotiations to conclude the armed conflict through political means as soon as practicable . the salvadoran government and the fmln will foster the country 's democratization and reunite salvadoran society . the dialogue is meant to serve as an instrument for reaching an agreement on cessation of hostilities . the agreement that the government signed in mexico says nothing of talking about or negotiating the fmln 's demobilization but mentions negotiations to encourage democratization to agree on the cessation of hostilities . by increasing the number of human rights violations , cristiani is closing the door to democratization . this , plus his refusal to reach an agreement with the fmln , makes him guilty of noncompliance with the commitments that the government made at esquipulas . 3. in accordance with the commitment we made in mexico and with the regional accords , we also call on the salva

trigger_output_sentence comrades : a new element that we must analyze and explain emerged at the conclusion of the central american presidents ' emergency meeting . let us see first why the meeting took place . the main reason is the very complicated predicament in which our offensive has placed cristiani and the high command . as you will remember , the government has met with much international disrepute and isolation because of the brutal assassination of jesuit priests and the bombing of the civilian population . let us recall , as a significant fact , that the united nations has condemned the government because of all it has done , especially because of the latest atrocities . on that occasion , el salvador was the only country that voted against that resolution while 96 countries voted in favor . we mention this case as a most significant one , but the fact is that there has been so much worldwide condemnation that the dictatorship has found itself in a really desperate situation . this was a cause of concern for the north americans . to whom could they turn at a time when all international organizations had turned their backs on cristiani ? the north americans had to resort to some forum that would not condemn the genocidal regime and that , on the contrary , would provide support in spite of all the atrocities the regime has committed . the most suitable idea was to promote an emergency meeting of central american presidents , because in central america , as we all know , the north americans have had their backyard and most of these countries serve their interests . the meeting was called to try to pull cristiani out of international isolation . under what conditions did summit take place ? we have to say first that the presidents of el salvador and costa rica , and probably of guatemala , had reached an agreement prior to the meeting . the subject of the discussion was a document drafted by arias and cerezo . this document expressed support for cristiani from the very beginning . joseph sullivan , a u.s. state department official in charge of latin american affairs , as well as other u.s. state department officials . in addition to the

( begin recording ) ( maza ) the das has evidence showing that this individual masterminded two attacks including the the most recent and worst one in which more than 60 innocent people were killed . ( reporter ) how do you know that gonzalo rodriguez gacha masterminded the recent attack on das ? ( maza ) because the investigations that we have conducted along with the national police ever since the attack occurred point in that direction . if we compare the modus operandi of rodriguez and his people , we come to the conclusion that the period between the ( word indistinct ) and the action itself are very similar . furthermore , this man was in there celebrating the genocide that he had committed in bogota . ( reporter ) ( question indistinct ) ( maza ) because the intelligence reports indicate this , and according to certain statements we have , he was overjoyed by the damage that he had caused in the city given the large number of people who were killed ; seeing him sunbathing and swimming on the atlantic coast led us to believe this . ( reporter ) is this a police reaction to the drug traffickers ' attack on das ? ( maza ) no , i am not saying that it is a reaction . this is the result of very professional work on the part of the national police . that is what i told the president today . i briefed him on the events which led to the action that has changed the situation which had prevailed in the country just a few hours ago .

trigger_output_sentence regarding the jesuits ' case , the fmln states that : 1. the fmln and several sectors , including young armed forces officers , were right in pointing to the army as being responsible for this horrible crime . the responsibility of the armed institution for this case and the cases involving fenastras ( salvadoran workers national union federation ) , monsignor romero , the nuns , and the u.s. agrarian experts , as well as for the bombings in the cities and massacres in the rural sector , show that we were right when we mentioned in our last peace proposal the need to clean up the army and reform the judicial system . 2. to advance in the country 's democratization , it is not enough to solve this case . the other cases need to be solved and those guilty for them should be punished . the establishment of responsibilities can not remain at the level of officers and troops who only carried out orders . most important is to establish responsibility among higher-ranking officers because a decision of this sort could not be beyond the responsibility of the top command . 3. it is also necessary to comply with the esquipulas ii agreements concerning democratization ; reforming the judicial system ; lifting the state of emergency ; reestablishing freedom of expression , mobilization , and organization ; releasing the more than 3,000 political prisoners ; and stopping the repression against the church and other sectors . 4. the announcement by cristiani is an effort to resolve complicated discussions on u.s. aid for el salvador and to continue to benefit from this aid to maintain the war . it would be a mistake to increase aid to the salvadoran army because of this announcement or because the case may be resolved . such aid would leave open the possibility of seeing a case like that of the jesuit priests happening again . the best way to contribute to a negotiated solution is to cease aid . we appeal to the u.s. congress to make this decision . if this is done , the fmln would commit itself to making efforts to reach an immediate ceasefire . 5. favorable conditions for negotiations depend on justice-making

trigger_output_sentence the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) has decided to combine the people 's rejection of the 19 march elections with an intensification of actions throughout the nation . this includes the nationwide transportation stoppage , which we now declare to be indefinite . the rejection of the 19 march elections by our people and the impact of our actions have led the regime to launch a campaign of disinformation , aggression , and threats against the civilian population in a bid to confuse the population and , in addition , to set the stage for an electoral fraud . in order to make matters clear to our people as well as to the local and international press , we report the following : 1. the gagging of the national press is part of the plan to cover up the fraud that will be committed on 19 march . in addition , the control over the media is intended to attribute terrorist actions to the fmln . 2. the regime has tried to blame us for a number of actions , such as the attack on a red cross ambulance , among others , for the same purpose . the fmln has a definite policy of not harming the civilian population . the hurling of grenades at bus stops is a common practice of army personnel and it is therefore preposterous to blame the fmln . 3. a number of false communiques with an obvious terrorist tone have appeared . they clumsily glorify violence and threaten the press in terms that are quite unlike those appearing in documents in which we outline our official position . we emphatically state that the fmln has in no way or at any time threatened the press or the citizens . we recall the fact that our official communiques are signed by our general command and broadcast through our stations . we reiterate that the fundamental thing at this time is to reinforce and expand unity in the search for peace through every possible means . the struggle which we are waging with weapons in hand is aimed at an army that has once more denied to our nation the possibility of finding a formula for a negotiated solution at an important crossroads in the nation 's history . we made a proposal to hold free elections , in peace and for peace , but the army stubbornly insists on holding fraudulent

trigger_output_sentence political life in colombia is still linked with violence ... .. ( cepeda ) colombia is experiencing an extremely severe political and institutional crisis , caused by the incompatibility between the fast developing productive forces and the existing political setup . for example , last year colombia 's economic growth was 4.5 percent . however , political life continues to be dominated by the two old parties -- the liberals and the conservatives , who maintain a merely formal democracy . we should not forget colombia 's strategic position : it forms a bridge between central and south america . all events in colombia affect the neighboring countries . precisely because of this , the so-called  santa fe-2 '' document , drawn up by extreme right-wing u.s. politicians , contains a plan to apply pressure in colombia and , more specifically , to expand the so-called low-intensity conflict , one of whose manifestations is the so-called  dirty war '' in the country . accordingly , the violence in colombia is caused by both internal factors -- the crisis of the institutions -- and external ones , namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the united states . ( sertov ) can one expect the peace settlement to be fulfilled under these conditions ? ( cepeda ) this is the aim of the communist party of colombia ( pcc ) . at our recent 15th congress , we made a detailed analysis of the situation and concluded that the conflict in colombia must be settled by political means . the pcc raised the question of removing the siege situation that , with a few interruptions , has been maintained for several decades , and of disbanding the paramilitary groups ( according to the minister of internal affairs , about 140 such groups are operating ) . these groups owe their very existence to the support given by military circles and the clan chiefs to the trade in narcotics .

( begin recording ) ( barco ) i came to make an appeal to you . let us all combine our efforts and energies in an alliance that is stronger and better coordinated than that of the drug traffickers . we need an alliance of nations affected by drug trafficking in order to respond effectively . drug trafficking is not the problem of a single nation , or even of a group of nations . it is a universal outrage . unless we devise strong and effective means of international cooperation to fight against all phases of the problem , a final victory will not be possible . for this reason , i wish to use this forum to make a new proposal to reflect the sense of urgency that we all feel with regard to this problem . we -- all presidents of the american hemisphere , along with president bush and our other colleagues of those nations most affected by the international drug trafficking scourge -- should meet as soon as possible to jointly exercise the public , political authority conferred upon us by the will of our people .

trigger_output_sentence good evening ladies and gentlemen . today we will discuss the foreign debt problem . this subject could perhaps seem a bit out place at a time when more troublesome matters affect all argentine families , such as high public utility rates , prices , controls , difficulties , etc . however , we must attend to the foreign debt problem because most our difficulties come from it . of what does this problem consist ? we currently owe $ 64 billion . this represents a burden of $ 6 billion yearly in interest payments . since argentina is currently exporting $ 9 billion annually , and if we paid $ 6 billion in interest , we would only have $ 3 billion left annually to attend to all our national needs , that is , the needs of industry , commerce , etc . obviously this is not enough money , and we can not pay $ 6 billion in interest each year with $ 9 billion worth of annual exports . this is not new . this is a heavy inheritance , which originated not in the recent past but more than 10 years ago . when martinez de hoz became economy minister ( march 1976 ) , the foreign debt amounted to $ 9 billion . when he concluded his term , the debt amounted to $ 29 billion . the military governments that came after him dragged the debt along and increased it to $ 44 billion which they passed to president alfonsin . alfonsin 's administration increased the debt by an additional $ 20 billion . so today our debt amounts to $ 64 billion . this is not all . we ceased honoring our commitments abroad . we have not even paid interest since april last year . we have only made token payments . this refutes the ideas of those who say : let us stop paying our debt and use the resources to make the country grow . we are not paying anything . for more than a year we have not been paying anything , and not only has the economy not grown , but it shrank . argentina has an extremely low credit rating . countries are internationally classified by their credit , and we are in one of the lowest categories . our commercial credit is also being curtailed . commercial credits are the ones that allow us to import

( passage omitted ) this is the last message i will deliver to congress as president before i turn the presidency over to a citizen elected by the people . i can not fail to expand on the achievements made this year , which , honestly speaking are much fewer than in previous years . i am delivering a summary of these achievements in writing , as establish by the constitution , for the use of the legislators . it is a summary of material achievements . it is now more important to me to say that the main objective of the government in the next 12 months will be to reaffirm the system of democratic freedom , which is the most important system peru has . with this freedom , even the most extreme positions can exist . the reactionary positions of the ultraright and radical ideologies can also live in freedom . violence has less chance of developing in freedom . the nation has more legitimate means to eradicate violence under freedom . like any other citizen , i also believe that sometimes disagreements , political parties , laws , and skillful legal procedures can

trigger_output_sentence article 5 adds : all men from 18 to 50 years of age and women from 18 to 45 years of age are obliged to comply with this law , thus this period of life is called military age . this means that all 18- to 50-year-old peruvians are of military age , and we are obliged to comply with the compulsory military service law , in the reserve . therefore , one not only complies with the military service law when one is assigned on active duty to a military garrison for 1 or 2 years , but one continues complying with this law by remaining in the reserve until 50 years of age . article 272 of the military service law states : men from 18 to 50 years of age and women between 18 and 45 years of age who are not on active military service all belong to the reserve , and they must comply with the obligations established by clause 4 of this law . if the law states this , i then ask all peruvians : are not terrorists -- who are part of the armed forces reserves and who take arms to attack the national police and armed forces -- violating the obligatory military service law ? is not he , who by violent means tries to destroy the constitutional system of which the armed forces are part , violating the military service law ? therefore , since article 282 of the constitution states that those who violate the compulsory military service law can be tried by the military code of justice , then terrorists can be tried by military courts . thus the idea is that one law , one article , should establish that the crime of terrorism violates the military service law , therefore enabling a quick and drastic punishment for terrorists . it will therefore not be necessary to ammend the constitution . a correct interpretation of the constitution is all that will be needed . we must also remember that when the current constitution was approved there was no serious terrorist problem . besides , you must know that to ammend the constitution we must wait nearly 2 years , and we have no time to waste . many peruvians think that if military courts try terrorists they will be sentenced to death . this is false , it is not correct . the military courts will only rule sentences in keeping with the law , but these sentences will be applied

trigger_output_sentence the extensive border shared by venezuela and colombia is today , more than ever , the cause of concern for the caracas government . the offensive against drug trafficking ordered by president barco is viewed by local commentators as a dangerous threat to venezuela due to its proximity to colombia , with whom venezuela shares over 2,000 km . the border with colombia has always been a cause of concern for venezuelan governments . on several ocassions venezuela had to face raids into its territory , as well as the kidnapping of stockbreeders , smuggling of goods , and drug trafficking by colombian guerrillas and criminals . the war declared by the colombian government on the medellin cartel opens up the possibility that many of the drug chieftains , and perhaps some drug kingpins , may seek refuge in venezuelan territory . venezuelan president carlos andres perez warned that if drug traffickers attempt to transfer their industries to venezuela they will have to  face venezuelan justice , and certainly extradition trials .

trigger_output_sentence it is clear that neo-liberalism is the ideology of the north . if in the past liberalism was a factor that promoted progress and independence in latin america , neo- liberalism is now the state ideology of the more powerful nations . it is an authoritarian ideology that does not question all types of states , but only the states of the south . under the guise of eliminating bureaucracy and promoting efficiency , neo-liberalism wants to destroy the state to eliminate any resistance to the hegemony of the world market . we should not play that game . ideological nonalignment should therefore redefine the state and defend its strength in our countries . when i say state i am not referring merely to the individual states that every one of us represents . i am referring to an accord that our states should reach in each region . we must recognize that we are united in continental blocs . we must promote our regional economy . only through regional initiatives will we have power in the current process of restructuring the market . it is therefore imperative to call -- in each continent -- more frequent and regular meetings of our movement . we must organize the nonaligned movement on a continental basis to strengthen it in all places . many have come to this meeting to propose an administrative structure for our movement to insure its continuity . this can be viewed as a suggestion . it is a lot more important , though , to recognize the existence of regional differences and to create intermediate nonaligned movement organizations wherever possible . these intermediate organizations should strengthen the principles of the movement in each region , thus expanding its power . although it 's taken sometime , i believe that we have already adopted this approach in latin america through the creation of the political consultation mechanism of the group of eight , which gives common answers to the economic crisis and to political intervention . mr president , in honoring our founders -- tito , nehru , and nasser -- i should stress the ethical significance of nonalignment . without the power of nuclear bombs or money , we have upheld the moral values of mankind to help it to continue to struggle in all fields . therefore , our movement can not remain indifferent

trigger_output_sentence a u.s. department of state spokesman has indicated that washington proposes to continue helping the salvadoran regime until the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) combatants surrender their arms . the timing of this statement is remarkable . let us recall that less than 1 week ago representatives of the rebel forces and the salvadoran government met in mexico , thus launching a dialogue aimed at a national reconciliation . the parties agreed to continue these talks in costa rica on 16 and 17 october , however , even the first round of talks in mexico showed that continuing the war was pointless because neither of the parties is capable of military defeating the other . thus , the only possible victory for all is the victory of common sense . this can be achieved only through national dialogue . the rebels have correctly made it clear that no preconditions can be set for continuing dialogue , and less still can it be demanded that the fmln combatants should unilaterally surrender their arms . it should be noted this demand is being made while the salvadoran government is getting considerable military aid from the united states and , according to the department of state spokesman , it has no plans to discontinue this aid . the salvadoran military is using u.s.-made weapons only against the rebels and not against any foreign enemy . it is well known that throughout the 10 years of civil war in el salvador , the united states has supplied almost $ 4 billion worth of military and nonmilitary aid to that country . thanks to this assistance , 70,000 salvadorans have been killed and over 1 million people have had to leave the country to save their lives . we can see that additional u.s. military aid will inflict further untold suffering and misfortunes on the salvadoran people . putting an end to this assistance and to any further interference in salvadoran domestic affairs would help dispel mutual distrust and would create in the country an atmosphere favorable to national dialogue . washington 's demands that the rebels should surrender their arms as a precondition for washington to reconsider the issue of military aid to the salvadoran regime represents

trigger_output_sentence we report to you the following considerations related to the present situation in the search for a just and lasting peace in el salvador . 1. we note with deep concern that there has been an alarming increase in human rights and humanitarian war norms violations by the government and the armed forces . these violations can be observed in the repression of demonstrations , tortures , murders , arrests -- more than 400 in the past month -- disapearances , and in the government 's refusal to allow maimed farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) members to leave the country to get medical attention . this norm is stipulated in the geneva convention , and this is an agreement that has been signed by the salvadoran government . this situation has been clearly demonstrated by the resolution issued by the subcommission ( 30-second break in reception ) period in august 1989. mr cristiani said this resolution was not truthful . 2. government spokesmen and mr cristiani himself have repeatedly stated that the achievement of peace depends on the fmln 's halting hostilities . this presents a unilateral plan that has not been agreed upon politically , militarily , or operationally . in contrast to these statements , when the fmln unilaterally declared a truce recently , mr cristiani , officials in his administration , and military commanders stated that these fmln measures were propagandistic and that the truce was not respected . their arguments were attempts to justify the government 's breaking of the truce . these events give us additional grounds for stating that a definite and unconditional halt to hostilities is unrealistic and unfeasible .

trigger_output_sentence president arias was right when he said that perhaps fidel castro is the only one who insists on the situation -- and who seems to have not yet returned from the sierra maestra where he was in 1959. that seems to be the attitude of the fmln leaders . what else do the armed forces , i mean ( corrects himself ) , does the fmln want with all these absurd proposals and attitudes ? it is seeking to divide the armed forces . it is seeking to isolate the government of the republic . it wants to ( discredit ) the government image , which has been consolidated little by little at the international level , because we are showing to the world that there is a democracy here , that a democratic process is being consolidated , and that the forces that already exist within the democratic system are forces that truly want and seek peace , rather than forces that assassinate and cause destruction . therefore , we can no longer think at this moment , that the fmln has only viewed the dialogue from a strategic point of view . however , we want to say something . all this strategy should not confuse the salvadoran people . we must be calm because the government of the republic will not give an inch and will continue , through rational means , to struggle and search for peace , to which you and all salvadorans are entitled . we are not going to fall into the traps the fmln is trying to put before us . however , at this moment , what we should see is who wants peace and who does not want to search for peace . up to this moment , the fmln has given no evidence it wants to attain peace and tranquility for you , the salvadoran people . nevertheless , we must not be pessimistic . although it is true that one can not say , for propaganda purposes , that outstanding results were obtained at the meeting in san jose , costa rica , some results were attained . the dialogue process will continue and that should eliminate all traces of pessimism . we must think that the dialogue process that began in mexico was not broken in san jose

( reporter ) at a news conference held yesterday at the und , the nationalist democratic union , it was said that the participation of two u.s. advisers and one u.s. military adviser prevented greater progress in the dialogue . how do you feel about that ? ( larios ) we must never forget that terrorists try to confuse and try to foster an attitude and actions in the people solely to justify themselves . at no time was the military delegation , which participated as advisers in the dialogue , able to influence the decisions of the dialogue commission . their role as advisers enabled them to give advice to the dialogue commission , but it is absurd to think that the presence of our two military advisers and other advisers prevented real and complex positions from being taken at that meeting . ( reporter ) there is no u.s. adviser ... ( larios , interrupting ) moreover , we can not ... . ( changes thought ) no u.s. adviser accompanied our delegation . if there was one , he went strictly on his own . your question , therefore , is important , because it allows us to tell you that the salvadoran military delegation never hampered the work of the government delegation during the talks . ( reporter ) the nongovernment human rights commission presented the relatives of tortured and captured persons . it accused 1st infantry brigade commander francisco elena fuentes and other officers of having ties to the death squads . ( larios ) i have been dealing with these kinds of reports over the past few days . friends -- and here i am appealing to my friends -- let us not allow the terrorists ' desperate actions to confuse and convey a false message to the people . the fact is that this is part of the strategy of deceit , lies , and disrespect for the people and the country 's democratic institutions implemented by the terrorists .

trigger_output_sentence a few days after the start of the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) offensive , the results are completely positive . first of all , we are seeing the total political defeat of the democracy and counterinsurgency plan because the cristiani government has been unmasked as a fascist dictatorship . the u.s. counterinsurgency model tried to legitimize , through an electoral process , a quote , democratic , unquote , government which would leave the growing popular insurgency in el salvador with no reason to exist . that model has overwhelmingly failed because , instead of an even timidly democratic government , what has been installed is a regime that does not even tolerate the christian democratic party , which it views as a great traitor to the fatherland . a regime has been established which does not permit the most minimal opportunities for the free expression of thought . it does not tolerate the existence of an objective and independent newscast , such as that of television canal doce . it is a regime which demands that the highest leaders of the church leave the country because it does not guarantee their security . it is a regime that issues totally undemocratic laws and closes all political opportunities . in short , it is a regime in a state of emergency . it is a fascist regime with all its components . that is the final result of the u.s. efforts to establish a counterinsurgent democratic regime in el salvador . the little legitimacy that the cristiani government at one point enjoyed was destroyed when it had to cover up and permit the assassination of six jesuit priests to go unpunished , and when it indiscriminately bombed the more densely populated areas of the country . a few days of the offensive have been enough to tear down the foundations of the erroneous u.s. policy in our country . and the validity of that policy has begun to be seriously questioned in the united states . a second great achievement of these first weeks of the offensive has been a radical change in the theaters of operation . we have placed the war in its
trigger_output_sentence the enemy is left like that , hanging from a thread -- a strategic thread which can break at any moment and result in a military setback for the army . the phenomenon which ensued after the masses joined the offensive in its early stages forced the enemy to indiscriminately use the air force to prevent a general uprising and to curtail the insurrection . nevertheless , the effort exerted to launch a nationwide offensive has been based on a large-scale peasant and suburban insurrection process . our ranks were considerably increased to render the offensive effective , and this was possible thanks to the people 's great interest in fighting in the cities and speeding up the outcome of the war . the people also joined our ranks during the fighting which occurred in the cities . furthermore , the germ of a new social explosion has been created by the government itself , with its indiscriminate bombings and repression . even though some people may blame the fmln for the army 's brutal reaction , few can feel any sympathy for those who have bombed them . this has created a social situation which guarantees the continuity of the fmln 's offensive until victory is achieved . all the people displaced by the bombings are dissatisfied people who will join the struggle sooner or later . we remember the phenomenon of the displaced people and refugees caused by the bombings in the salvadoran countryside . the brutal attitude of the army and air force has legitimized the armed struggle . the other party , meaning the enemy , had to grab all the resources of a conventional war : airplanes , helicopters , and heavy artillery . this legitimizes the people 's armed struggle and self-defense . a third great achievement of the national and strategic effort exerted against fascism has been the liberation of large zones of the national territory . a new , emerging power now controls eight departments of the country . the army is spread thin and it had to abandon the zones where it can not keep its men -- compromised as it is in the strategic defense of the cities . this puts the army throughout the national territory in a situation resembling a cloth
trigger_output_sentence there is no longer room for the idea of dialogue without negotiation . now we must negotiate in earnest . that demand has been made by several governments and international forums , and even by some influential sectors in the united states . yet cristiani has opposed this universal current . cristiani 's tactical , propagandistic , and delaying moves around the negotiations table will no longer have a chance to succeed . on the other hand , it will now be an indispensable condition that dialogue and negotiation be expanded and that the real decisionmakers be the ones who sit at the negotiating table . finally , following the offensive launched by the fmln , the analysts , especially in the united states , have admitted that there is a need to carry out an in-depth study of the value of the u.s. government 's policy toward el salvador . the debate on the conditioning , and even the total suspension , of military aid to the salvadoran army is very intense , and it has already shaken the foundations of bipartisanship regarding u.s. support for the cristiani government . you will recall that the debate has not continued because the u.s. congress has declared a recess ; however , it will soon become the center of the u.s. congress ' debates . in summary , we could say that the enemy has lost ground and legitimacy , and the basis for its support , the u.s. aid , is being seriously threatened . in addition , the army has been reduced to the strategic defense of an important center , the capital city . therefore , it is only logical to say that today we saw a very worried , even desperate , cristiani . cristiani 's speech on the radio and television network shows an attempt to retouch the picture . cristiani tried to lower the level of the water that has reached his neck by diverting the world 's attention from the bombings and the deaths of the jesuit priests to nicaragua . in this desperate effort , all that cristiani has done is to take the war to other and more dangerous levels . he is attempting to regionalize the war ,

trigger_output_sentence judging by news agency reports , the development of events in el salvador has reached an extremely dangerous point . president cristiani 's refusal to respond to the insurgents ' recent cease- fire proposal has resulted in a fresh outbreak of bloodshed . having rejected out of hand last week the very idea of the resumption of talks with the farabundo marti liberation movement , the government has made no secret of its intention of quickly driving the guerrillas back into the mountains using u.s. military supplies .  elite '' army battalions had already prepared for punitive assaults . but what happened ? the regime 's gamble on military force proved futile . the insurgents regrouped their forces , brought up reserves , and struck a powerful new blow . the salvadoran drama is increasingly sharply at variance with the improvement of the international climate . representatives of the united nations , the oas , the eec , the vatican , france , and a number of other countries and organizations are now stressing the acute need to urge the warring sides in el salvador to reach a peaceful settlement based on mutual compromise . and it is a very great pity that such an appeal has not come from that capital which the salvadoran authorities heed above all others -- washington . attention is drawn to the urgent evacuation of u.s. citizens from el salvador that was announced yesterday . i recognize that in the conditions of an armed conflict this is a necessary step . but it is no secret that in the recent past such actions by the u.s. administration were an ominous symptom of the preparation of overtly interventionist plans . end the bloodshed -- that is the priority task today . and the restoration of the dialogue between the government and the insurgents that was broken off should be the first step toward that .

trigger_output_sentence fellow patriots , i am addressing the nation today to explain the government 's position concerning the issue of extradition , which was the subject of a very intense debate last night at the chamber of representatives ' first commission . a proposal was put forward to the effect that in the extraordinary referendum scheduled for 21 january -- which is contemplated in the constitutional reform that is currently in its final stages -- an additional question be included with regard to whether or not you , the colombian people , want colombian criminals to be extradited . this question would join four other issues that had already been approved for submission to popular consultation on 21 january . on behalf of the national government , the government minister immediately expressed the disadvantages of approving that proposal . i have consulted with former presidents alberto lleras , carlos lleras restrepo , alfonso lopez , and julio cesar turbay about including the extradition issue in the referendum , and they feel that with the current public order situation , especially when the government has been dealing successfully with the struggle against drug trafficking , it would be disadvantageous to use the referendum to decide on extradition . the country must not deceive itself as to where we would be headed if we held a referendum on the issue of extradition , and as to the fatal consequences of such an action on the country 's morale and on democracy 's survival . initially , i am not talking about extraditing colombian criminals for them to stand trial in other countries , but of extraditing drug traffickers who have committed crimes abroad . extradition is not punishment for society because it refers only to drug traffickers , neither is it an affront to sovereignty , as some people have tried to portray it . extradition has been dealt with in colombian international treaties . the direction of international policy lies within the exclusive realm of the presidency of the republic , according to the constitution . congress can not take the initiative of abolishing public extradition treaties by resorting to legislative or constituent provisions . this is clear in light of colombian public law , and it is imperative according to the vie

'' regarding peace in central america , the highest ranking leaders of the church in the area point out that there are many factors preventing or hampering efforts to build a long lasting peace . among the factors the bishops mention is  the persistence of serious social problems -- hunger , unemployment , the high cost of living , and the reality of an underprivileged class -- yet most rulers and other bodies holding power do

trigger_output_sentence the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) , with regard to the results of the extraordinary meeting of central american presidents , reports the following : 1. the results of the presidents ' meeting has allowed us to measure the depth of the crisis in el salvador and the impact of the fmln 's current military offensive , inasmuch as the summit 's entire effort was aimed at saving the salvadoran government from an extreme political and military crisis and from international isolation in exchange for a new promise on the immediate demobilization of the nicaraguan contras . 2. the fmln indignantly rejects the presidents ' declaration because , contrary to the dynamics of the entire international community , the clamor of democratic and social forces , and the clamor of churches in the country , this declaration unconditionally supports the leading violator of human rights in the region , a government that has murdered and persecuted the clergy and bombed the civilian population . this support encourages those who have unleashed that irrational violence and allows more murders in el salvador . 3. the san jose agreement does not contribute toward a negotiated solution in el salvador . the fmln can not be disbanded as the result of agreements between governments because the fmln constitutes a genuinely popular power throughout the salvadoran territory , a force that the huge u.s.-financed war machine has not been able to stop in 10 years . 4. as has already been said in private , the fmln agrees with un secretary general javier perez ' mediation to initiate serious negotiations with the participation of all of the country 's political and social forces . 5. we are hereby calling for international solidarity so other countries can mobilize immediately to defend the salvadoran people , who are in danger of suffering from an escalation in efforts to exterminate it because the fascist policy has been reinforced by the support that the central american presidents ' declaration offers to cristiani 's government . el salvador , 12 december

trigger_output_sentence on returning today from the central american summit held in costa rica , salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said that  the terrorist actions of the guerrillas are no longer justified from any point of view . '' pleased with the political support he obtained from his colleagues including nicaragua 's daniel ortega , cristiani said in a news conference that he will immediately resume the dialogue with the guerrillas  as soon as the guerrillas cease hostilities and publicly give up committing violent actions against the civilian population . '' the salvadoran president said that  in the summit there was a substantial change in that the presidents called the guerrillas by their names .

'' the presidents also asked the fmln to  publicly give up committing violent actions that directly or indirectly affect the civilian population , '' and to  rejoin the dialogue process '' that was suspended 2 months ago . the guerrillas accuse the alfredo cristiani government of being  the main violator of human rights '' and stated that the costa rica agreement  actually encourages those who have unleashed this irrational violence and it allows for an even greater slaughter in el salvador .

trigger_output_sentence ... he ( ortega ) was facing a fact he could no longer hide : he is the one who is spreading armed revolutions in central america and trying to hamper democratic processes in the region . once more he has been caught not honoring the commitments agreed on in tela , but rather violating these commitments . on this occasion he has been left with no possible defense . therefore , in our opinion , he has no option other than to accept the reality of what is happening in central america , or see himself totally isolated amid a peace plan that has international support . this situation would cause him many problems and headaches in political and diplomatic matters . he could do nothing but accept the reality . he could no longer defend the position that the nicaraguan resistance was something special and the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) was something else and was justifiable . it is now clear that he has run out of tricks and has had to accept what all the remaining four central american presidents are aware of and defended at the costa rican summit . now , if in their strategy they sold out the fmln , as has been mentioned here , they will have to give some explanations to their fmln friends . that is a problem between him and the fmln . what should be of interest to us is that the fmln 's violent and terrorist actions are no longer justified from any point of view . this has been clearly and strongly emphasized in the costa rican agreement . in this regard , i repeat that the salvadoran government is willing to resume the dialogue process from which the fmln unilaterally withdrew . however , at this time it is necessary for the fmln to openly promise -- and this is strongly demanded by the central american presidents , including the nicaraguan president -- it will cease terrorist actions , especially those affecting civilians . obviously a total demobilization and return to the democratic process -- with the guarantees that must be given to the fmln members -- will be the result of the dialogue process . this is how

trigger_output_sentence ... .i was in san jose , costa rica at a meeting of central american presidents . this meeting was of urgent nature to discuss issues such as el salvador , nicaragua , the contras ' demobilization , and human rights . at this meeting , we held in-depth discussions of problems that are being experienced in the central american countries , especially the situation being experienced in neighboring el salvador , which is facing an internal conflict -- more than a decade of continued war and internal conflict . el salvador has been subjected to a very strong confrontation , which lately has worsened . as you all know , the civilian population , the clergy , nuns , and union and labor leaders have been victims of this tragic situation . at this meeting , nicaragua stated its position that the situation in el salvador must be resolved through negotiation and not by way of violence . this position fully coincides with the position the fmln ( farabundo marti national liberation front ) has defended . on various occasions the fmln has made peace proposals and it has called for negotiated solutions to the salvadoran conflict and for real negotiations . following a lengthy and intense discussion of the salvadoran issue , we came to an agreement , not only with regard to general please and statements concerning the situation in the neighboring central american country , but on very specific issues that could lead to solution of the salvadoran conflict . thus , in point three , the five presidents decided to request that the un secretary general make a very special personal effort to bring about a dialogue between the salvadoran government and the fmln , thereby contributing toward the talks ' successful development . nicaragua has thus supported the negotiated solution the fmln has vigorously and consistently called for , and with which the government headed by president cristiani also claims to agree . such negotiation would lead to a dialogue process that would resulte in solving the salvadoran conflict . likewise , we underscored human rights in central america , because these rights are systematically violated in

trigger_output_sentence montenegro , we would like to know if the the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) will continue with the current military offensive that began on 11 november since the agreement among the central american presidents was signed ? ( montenegro ) the truth is that the reasons why the fmln began its offensive on 11 november 1989 have not changed at all . thus , the fmln can not stop its offensive . on the contrary , what happened in el salvador is that the fmln offensive strategically turned the war . that turn included a number of military , political , and diplomatic implications . thus , the truth is that the agreement signed in san isidro de coronado did not propose realistic negotiations for the conflict . yesterday , 12 december , the fmln issued a communique which vehemently expressed its absolute rejection of the agreement signed at the presidential summit . at present , the fmln believes that despite what the other four central american presidents say , it is clearer than ever that the salvadoran government is a fascist , military dictatorship . the salvadoran government violates people 's human rights and that fact has been clearly proved to the entire international community . therefore , any attempt to help the salvadoran government or any kind of support given to it nothing but a piece of paper that does not have too much validity to the fmln . ( bernard ) in other words comrade , the fmln will maintain the same level of confrontation with the dictatorship ? ( montenegro ) i believe the fmln 's armed struggle is now more legitimate than ever . the summit confirmed the legitimacy of the fmln 's struggle , because the agreement resulting from that summit is neither feasible nor real . the fmln will therefore continue its political - military offensive . the fmln will increase its actions . the fmln is reorganizing ( readecuar ) its political - military apparatus . in the next
trigger_output_sentence we could say that to a great extent the declaration is full of pretty words , similar to those cristiani uses , in the parts where the declaration calls on the fmln to join the alleged democratic process and says that the salvadoran government is legitimate . however , if we look carefully , we can see what is behind the words and that in addition to declaring support for the government , an attempt is made to do the salvadoran army a favor . this is done by asking the fmln to stop all violent actions that directly or indirectly affect the civilian population . we know that this is how the government refers to sieges on cities , to transportation strikes , and to sabotage , the army 's most serious sources of concern . underneath this declaration is a request for the fmln to leave the cities because the army can no longer stand the situation and feels it is near collapse . the declaration does not state any concern for bombings because considering the condition in which the government is now , any statement in this regard would be like adding fuel to the fire . the declaration is like a walking stick to keep the dictatorship up , and , as the fmln general command has stated in a communique , it is evidence of the political and military crisis in which this government has been placed as a result of the offensive carried out by all of you . to conclude : let us wait and see if this declaration will save cristiani from international isolation . it is important to take into consideration what the general command has stated in its communique , that the agreements by governments that do not know the true situation in our country and that serve other interests can not demobilize the fmln because the fmln enjoys popular support throughout the nation . the fmln is not like the contras who are in honduras and international organizations can go to their camps to demobilize them . in el salvador the situation is very different . cristiani himself was unable to answer a journalist who asked him if he was going to demobilize the fmln in san salvador , in guazapa , in chalaten

trigger_output_sentence now , just like 13 years ago when a democratic administration was installed in the white house , the relations between guatemala and the united states are particularly tense , and today , just like then , the reason for the tension in their bilateral relations is the human rights situation , because , according to the republican administration of george bush , the christian democratic government of vinicio cerezo does not seem to have enough political will to neutralize the problems that are affecting the security of citizens and individual guarantees . in march 1977 , newly installed u.s. president jimmy carter demanded that the regime headed by general kjell laugerud rectify a domestic policy that , according to the white house , was characterized by repressive practices against the opposition and peasant and labor groups . the guatemalan authorities reacted by rejecting u.s. military aid . the same position was adopted , amid very similar circumstances , by the military governments of jorge videla in argentina and augusto pinochet in chile . relations between guatemala and washington continued to be tortuous during the balance of the carter administration and only improved , relatively speaking , when republican ronald reagan took office in 1981. however , only years later -- with the commitment to democratization by de facto military governments that led the country from 1982 and 1985 -- was there a conciliatory attitude between guatemala and the united states that brought about quite harmonious relations between the governments of president cerezo and presidents reagan and bush until mid-1989 . on 27 february u.s. ambassador thomas strook criticized the guatemalan authorities ' failure to pursue the authors of murders and of kidnappings of political , student , and labor leaders , and thus worsened an atmosphere of confrontation that had resurfaced about six months ago when ambassador strook , who had just arrived in guatemala , objected to the appointment of colonel hugo moran carranza , former director of administrative control , to the post of manager of the santo tomas

'' the fpmr , which emerged in december 1983 , is made up of militants from communist youth groups and other extreme left organizations and young exiles who have returned to the country . the fpmr made headlines in august 1986 with the discovery of an arsenal that had been clandestinely shipped into northern chile . the fpmr was also in the news with the unsuccessful 7 september 1986 attack on chile 's chief executive , general augusto pinochet , which claimed the lives of five of pinochet 's bodyguards . aylwin also stated that the reestablishment of diplomatic ties

( passage indistinct ) but it has not been easy to advance toward national reconciliation in all the countries involved in the central american conflict . before the esquipulas agreement was signed in 1967 by the central american presidents , many international forces , which hindered a solution , were involved in the central american conflict . the military chiefs of el salvador and guatemala also rejected the negotiation process , assuming that they could defeat the rebel movement . in fact , during 10 years of civil war more than 70,000 people have been killed in el salvador and in nearly 30 years of conflict in guatemala more than 100,000 have been killed . it is obvious that the fratricidal war

( rivas ) mr. president , your replies to previous questions have already answered my first question . i would like to ask you something , however . now that the dialogue process is about to start , the two sides have apparently hardened their positions . the fmln commanders have said that , to end the war in el salvador , there must be a solution to the problems of injustice and lack of democracy . the minister of justice , in turn , said recently that the fmln must return to civilian life and that there is no need to negotiate . i would like to know what will be negotiated and what will be done to end the war through a dialogue with the fmln . ( cristiani ) i am surprised by the remarks that you are attributing to dr. santamaria , because he is very well informed about what has happened so far . he is very much aware that there is point two of the geneva agreement , which notes that political agreements must be reached in order to put an end to armed confrontation and the violence that is affecting the civilian population . subsequently , there will be a process for disarmament and demobilization , referred to as the total suspension of hostilities in the agreement . i believe that it is a matter of reaching agreements . we , as a government , are involved in this because we see the suffering of the salvadoran people . we believe that it is not fair for them to live in a climate of violence in which there are so many killed , so much destruction , and so many problems . as a government , we have always asked : what are the problems barring their returning to civilian life ? they are the only group that has not joined the salvadoran democratic process . what do they want ? let us see if there is anything reasonable that can be done . the political parties have expressed willingness to consider all that could foster or consolidate the democratic process in our country

( lohman ) mr. president , with the reduction in the u.s. government 's military aid , has your government considered the possibility of seeking military aid in other countries on this continent or from other parts of the world ? for example , we know that a country like israel has given military aid to central american countries . have you considered that possibility ? ( cristiani ) i can only tell you that , yes , certainly , the government of the republic has the duty of defending the system and the salvadoran democratic institutions , and -- regardless of what may happen , and we hope that will not occur -- if that happens , we will always have to seek alternate resources for the defense of the country 's democratic institutions .

''  just as they imposed the war , today they are also imposing conditions that contribute to the search for a negotiated political solution , '' the guerrilla leader said . a u.s. senate subcommittee voted for a cut in the u.s. military assistance to el salvador and linked another cut in the aid to the progress made in the negotiation process to end a war that has lasted a decade and left 72,000 people killed . to deal with the cut in military aid , the government of alfredo cristiani said that the situation would force it to make budget cuts in other areas , such as health and education . in this regard ,  jonas '' said that the government warnings are aimed at maintaining the military struggle at the expense of  severely punishing the people and all lower-class groups . '' however , melendez insisted that  the military policy in el salvador is weakening ... and new conditions are being opened . ''
trigger_output_sentence the military high command emphatically rejects the junior officer 's statements , considered a type of gray propoganda , because no person or group of persons has claimed responsibility for them . the statements are biased in favor of the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) . on 10 january 1981 a series of similarly anonymous letters and statements were circulated . the military intelligence learned that the letters were part of a strategy implemented by former captain francisco sandoval , along with other members of the salvadoran subversion . in addition , something similar happened in november 1989 , but this time it was done by a high-ranking member of the national union of salvadoran workers , who claimed that he had received a communique from junior officers on a number of irregularities that were reportedly occurring within the armed forces . the fmln terrorist groups launched offensives on both occasions . according to their goals , the final task was to seize power by force and by all means , even if they had to sacrifice the lives of many salvadoran civilians and severely damage houses and the country 's economic infrastructure . the armed forces are aware of their high level of professionalism and their own institutional ethics and philosophy as demanded by the constitution of the republic and reiterate that their mission will always be to defend the nation 's sovereignty and to protect each and every one of the salvadoran people 's life and interests . therefore , it is useless to try to undermine the armed forces ' morale and to confuse and divide all the members comprising the armed forces through groundless communiques which are intended to create false expectations for the national and international public .
trigger_output_sentence i have another question . a few moments ago , president cristiani termed the most ridiculous communique he had ever heard from the fmln the one in which they justified yesterday 's military actions . he termed them propaganda-oriented . within the framework of the negotiations , how do you view this ? ( ungo ) in my opinion , the fmln communique has aspects that are interesting and others which i think are not valid . the time and opportunity of that action is ambivalent . i think it has negative effects , as well as positive effects for them . there is always the famous vicious circle wherein if the fmln ceases to act militarily , it is bad for the fmln because it shows a sign of weakness . if it acts militarily it is also bad , because it shows that it does not want peace . in this sense , i think there is no doubt that it has exhibited a show of force , that its actions have been strictly propaganda-oriented or with propaganda objectives . it does not cease to create difficult conditions that generate a negative reaction on the other 's part , if they want to sit down and try to ease confrontations as much as possible and seek an agreement as much as possible . i believe , as i told president cristiani on the telephone yesterday when we spoke of other things but touched on this topic , that i uphold the government 's thesis . we have always criticized the fact that when negative things occur , they are invoked to suspend a process which in our opinion should be continuous . we have always upheld the continuity of the dialogue . the government criticized the fmln when on two occasions it suspended the dialogue due to terrorist actions on the part of the government or security corps . the dialogue and negotiation process has suffered as a result of this . i believe that in this case the government should take its own medicine . it should maintain the continuity of the process and not use as a pretext the fmln military actions to try to seek ways of conditioning or perturbing a process of dialogue and negotiation , which involves not only the government and the fmln , but the
